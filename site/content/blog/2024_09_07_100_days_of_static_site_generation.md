Alright folks, I've really done it now.

I'm going to build my own static site generator. Why? I don't understand Zola's philosophy and I'm banging my head against it instead of being productive.

I chose a theme for this site that is abandoned. The author is no longer supporting it. This bugs me. It's like a thorn in my side. I want to be on the latest build of Zola in order to take advantage of any new features.

I started a parallel blog effort, not using a theme at all, and I thought that was going well, but am fighting still against Zola itself. The concepts are not well explained, with sufficient examples and context, in the documentation. I suspect much of my problem is the Tera template engine and it's relative power...and associated complexity.

Anyhow, I'm going to go my own way.

In 100 days...maybe 102...I'd like to have something that does 10% of what Zola does, which is probably all I really need for a place to write and share what I'm learning. Even if I fail and crawl back to Zola, it's a valuable exercise.

This evening, I dusted off the repo I wrote about back in [late July](@/blog/2024_07_24_markdown_to_html_program_of_the_week.md). I realized this could serve as the basis or "engine" of a static site generator. I returned to it tonight and refined a few things, to practice for what is to come.

Alright, now I go off and figure out what I really want from a static site generator...
