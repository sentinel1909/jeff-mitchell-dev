is a bit of a different about page. I wrote this piece at the request of the Shuttle crew. I decided it would make a great (hopefully not too long) about page.\nWho am I?\nI'm an engineer who works in a field that is not related to software development. Computers are in my blood, I've been around them since I was a child. I can code and have danced with many tools over the years, but I'm not even remotely a professional. In the dark days of early COVID, I decided I wanted to learn how to code...really learn. I feel every engineer should know how as a means of expressing a solution to a problem. You might not do it every day, but it's a great tool to have in the belt.\nAlso, the notion of creating something from nothing has always fascinated me. This is what you do when you code, take a less than vague idea and turn it into a purposeful idea.\nI set off on a self-taught journey.\nGoals\nI didn’t start out immediately with this goal, but it’s grown over time. I want to be able to make simple services for not only for myself but also the company I work for. I want to do this with an ecosystem that supports me and makes it relatively painless to get things done. I say relatively because there so no such thing as truly painless. Very often, you're picking your pain.\nWhy Rust?\nAs I started writing this piece, I started to feel really foolish. The feeling got worse the more I wrote.\nI have no right to use Rust. Quite frankly it’s not necessary. I could work in anything that’s “easier”. Rust is not easy, the learning curve is legendary. The things it brings to the table are maximum overkill for literally anything I might want to create. I could use JavaScript, Go, C#, literally any garbage collected language.\nWhy Rust indeed.\nI began the journey with the intent to sit down and learn C++ once and for all. Much of the world's most flexible software is written with it. I dipped a toe in, completing a very basic course on Codecademy. One thing that I kept thinking as I went along, I'm not smart enough, when the chips are down, to do anything meaningful in C++.\nSo, if not C++, then...what?\nI spent time with vanilla web tech, including pure JavaScript, with a bit of dabbling into React, React Native, and NextJS. The trouble is, I dislike JavaScript...and I don't want to be the billionth person learning the traditional ways. I want to learn, use and advocate for something different. There are too many voices for the traditional tech stacks. I don't want to be part of that. I wanted something different.\nRust came onto my radar in early 2021. I installed it and began investigating. There are several aspects that drew, and continue to draw, me in.\nRules of the Road\nRust can go low and it can also go high. What I mean by that is you can get down into the dirt if you want, or you can stay up high with a web framework where someone else has dug in the dirt. The clear rules around memory use were really appealing to me. If I want to roll everything myself, I have a higher chance to create something safe out of the box, leaving me to worry mainly about logic errors. You get the power of C++ without the sleepless nights fretting about memory leaks, race conditions, and other nastiness.\nTooling\nA struggle with Javascript is layer upon layer of tooling, that you have to cobble together from different places. Newer JavaScript runtimes, such as Bun and Deno, are making strides to solve this, but there’s still a level of mental overhead. In Rust land, you have cargo as your package manager. Once you start using it, nothing else is good enough. When you leave it, you immediately miss it its coherence.\nPair Programming\nThe Rust compiler is very tough, but in a good way. Out of the box you have an immediate ally and pair programmer sitting beside you. I've learned a lot from it. I miss it when it’s gone. Clippy, Rust’s linter, is ready and waiting too, offering rich, helpful suggestions.\nTesting\nThis may be a cliche, but testing is a first class concept in Rust land. You don’t have to do anything special or pull in anything external to write tests. As a new, sole “developer” I need to be diligent and write tests. The fact it’s so easy is really appealing.\nThe Challenge\nRust is technically challenging. It presents a terrific puzzle to solve. Yes, it can be frustrating and at times can impede your progress, but the feeling when you get the pieces together is second to none. The feeling when you can just sit down and get some Rust code down to accomplish something is really wonderful.\nMy Approach to Learning\nEarly Days\nI’ve always been someone who learns by example. Reading theory and trying to build straight from that has always been a challenge. I get bored quickly just exploring the individual building blocks. I need to see an end goal, then I go about putting together the pieces, breaking them down and gaining insight along the way.\nWhen I started in early 2021, there weren’t a lot of learning materials from which to gain context and best practices. I used Medium articles quite a bit, and made my first attempt to get through the Rust Book, which of course, is the consensus starting point. In these early days, the power and point of the type system wasn’t quite visible. I found the basics of Rust similar to C, which I knew a little from the past, so this was an early hook.\nI did drift away from time to time, as I do suffer from \"grass is greener, maybe \"X\" is easier syndrome\", trying out other corners and other languages. However, Rust had made a mark on me and I always kept an eye on it. The promises it brought to the table we too great to overlook.\nZero to Mastery\nI came to realize I wasn’t achieving anything by dancing around. I wanted to get back to Rust. I decided I needed a course, enter Zero to Mastery and the Rust course by Jayson Lennon. I enrolled in March 2022 and spent the next few months working through his amazing course. It's taught like a beginner programming course, building up from the very basics. I highly recommend it. Jayson is a fantastic teacher. He's very active and supportive on the Zero to Mastery Discord.\nZero to Production in Rust\nI attempted to work through Zero to Production in Rust, by Luca Palmieri before fully completing the Zero to Mastery Rust course. It was a mistake, for two reasons, a) I wasn’t ready and b) I rushed too much and didn’t focus on the journey. In early 2023, I returned to it again, this time pushing myself to use a different web framework, Axum instead of Actix Web. This turned out to be an excellent move. It was challenging for sure, and admittedly, the unfortunate tendency to rush to the finished \"thing\" was still there, but it made me think and engage more. I had to start getting acquainted with crate documentation in order to figure out and implement the steps of the project. I highly recommend \"ZerotoProd\", it's an essential step for new Rustaceans.\nContributing to Open Source\nSomewhere early in 2023, I discovered Shuttle. Re-discovered is maybe better, as I as aware of the project since late 2022. Again, I dove in with both feet and started helping with their documentation. In the summer of 2023, I tentatively put my name down to actually work in the Shuttle code base. I helped implement a few new methods for Shuttle Persist. I felt so stupid, banging my head for hours sometimes, slinging code hoping something would stick. The Shuttle Team was so gracious, quietly coaching and pointing the way. The work I did really helped with some things I was struggling with, chief of which was testing. I had to learn how to write unit tests to support the code I added. I'm sure the Team have re-factored and thrown away what I originally wrote by now, but seeing it committed and in the Code base was a wonderful feeling. Contributing to open source...to something real, was an essential step in the journey. I continue to help with simple things and nurse the desire to, someday, really help with a big new feature.\nShuttle Christmas Code Hunt\nIn December 2023, the Shuttle folks started the first ever “Christmas Code Hunt”, in the vein of Advent of Code. In contrast to that, the Shuttle challenges were far more approachable. At first, I thought, I’ll add to the challenge by using Tower, rather than a higher level web framework. By this time, crate documentation was less mystical to me, and I figured out enough theory that I felt I could get somewhere. I did…mostly. With a bit of kind community help, I completed the first few challenges before dropping off. I intend to return to these challenges in the future.\nIteration, Diffusion and Consistency\nOverall, iteration and repetition are key to me learning anything, especially Rust. I repeat things, perhaps with small variations, that build muscle memory. I can now organize a project into a binary and library, with modules, effortlessly. Project organization was difficult at first, understanding file and folder boundaries, and how Rust treats them, was a challenge. The material in the Rust Book was abstract for my liking, lacking in specific, practical examples. Once it clicked, it suddenly became very logical.\nWhat I think of as diffusion, or diffuse learning, was important too. You really do have to let your brain absorb and process things over time. It's nice to have little moments where something you struggled with for months suddenly clicks and becomes second nature. This can only happen if you give the brain time to sit back and process.\nConsistency is the last piece. I've done something with coding literally almost every single day since I started in late 2020. Don't underestimate how small steps over a long period of time add up to something great.\nPath Forward\nI will continue to use Rust wherever I can. My journey with it has been a pleasant challenge. There have been moments of frustration and drift, but I really am enjoying the journey. I haven't made much for myself personally, but am working on using Rust at work. The project I'm most proud of is a sort of \"availability tracker\" for staff to use that indicates their availability to take on more work. It also lets them show upcoming vacation time, so that others can plan accordingly. I built this app with Actix Web on the backend, which serves up a Tera template for the UI. A Postgres database saves all the information which is displayed by Tera template. I've also embarked on a redo of our office intranet site, which I initially did in React, but going forward it will be done with Yew, which is a very pleasant Rust frontend framework. The project will solidfy my knowledge of form handling and fetching in Yew. I'm also figuring out how to leverage the wasm-bindgen crate to step back and forth between Rust and JavaScript.\nClosing Thoughts\nI'm no computer scientist or full fledged software developer, I realize the thoughts in this piece are probably a little thin and my rationale for choosing Rust may come across as a little contrived. There are a lot of tools out there and I could have easily picked anything. If Rust didn’t exist, I’d probably just be in JavaScript like everyone else, blissfully unaware. However, I’m happy there's a choice. I love that there exists a tool that takes whole classes of bugs off the table and supports me in the desire to create quality, efficient, and safe software.\nAlthough I'm not the most qualified person in the world at Rust programming, I will continue to advocate for its use and adoption. I would encourage anyone interested to dive in head first and carve a unique path.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/about/","title":"about me"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/","title":""},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/":{"body":"","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/","title":""},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-05-baby-steps-with-rust/":{"body":"Why?\nLate in 2020, I decided I needed to properly learn to code. The goal is to modernize myself and build things that will help myself and eventually the world around me. I’ve danced with several things but at the beginning of 2022 decided to double down on the Rust language. Rust is an immensely powerful tool which can be used to create pretty much any kind of software imaginable. It has a steep learning curve, but it’s well worth mastering. Rust is inherently safe and performant, has excellent tools, and some of the best compiler help I’ve ever experienced.\nRust is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS and generally can be used to create software for any/all of these platforms. I say generally because you will hit the odd occasion where certain libraries (referred to as “crates” in the Rust world) are only compiled for say Linux but not Windows or macOS. I hit this last year when following a tutorial to build a vim clone, one of the supporting crates was only compiled for Linux. The project wouldn’t work on Windows.\nThis is a short article which will help you get off the ground should you wish to explore this language.\nAssumptions:\n\na solid foundation of general computer skills\ncomfort with the command line (on the platform of your choice)\nexperience in another compiled programming language (I don’t recommend coming to Rust cold, you should pick something else first if you have no previous experience)\nyou’re using Visual Studio Code as your editor\n\nConcepts:\nRust is a compiled language, meaning the programs you write need to be translated (compiled) into a format that your computer can use. This is different from an interpreted language, in which you can write your programs and have the computer immediately do the work so you can see the result. If you’d like a more in-depth explanation of the difference, this article on freeCodeCamp is a great start.\nRust uses a system of packages, crates, and modules in which to organize code, The Rust Book states:\n\nRust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system\n\nCargo is Rust’s package management tool. Cargo allows you to build, test, run and deploy your program. You can create Rust programs without it, but I don’t recommend that. I will use Cargo exclusively for the rest of this article as well as in everything I write/do going forward.\nInstallation:\nIf you haven’t already, follow the official installation instructions for your computer platform to get Rust installed.\nGreeting\nIt’s a cliche, but let’s make a program that says hello and displays your name. Create a directory in a location of your choosing and type:\n\nThis will create a new binary project in a directory called HelloWorld. Rust programs fall into two broad types, binaries and libraries. A binary is an independent program which can be run on its own. A library cannot be run on its own and is meant to be used as a dependency internally to your program or by other Rust programs.\nNext, type:\n\nThis will change you into the freshly created HelloName project directory. From here, fire up Visual Studio code by typing:\n\nVisual Studio Code will launch and open the HelloWorld directory and display all its contents in the file browser. You should see a directory called src, click on it to reveal main.rs, the entry point of the bare bones Rust program that Cargo created for you. Cargo actually mocks up all the code we need without anything additional. The code should look like this:\n\nThis extremely simple starting point highlights some key components of a Rust program:\n\nthe main() function serves as the entry point to your program\nwe bind the string \"Jeff\" to a variable called \"name\" (you should change this to be your own name!)\nthe println! macro takes the string \"Hello, {}!\" as an argument, inserts the value of name in place of the curly braces and prints it to the console\n\nThe other key items to note are are that Rust expressions must terminate with a semi-colon and expressions and statements within a function are surrounded by curly braces. The curly braces are especially important in the discussion of ownership, a core memory management feature offered by Rust\nTo run our very basic program, back at the command line, type:\n\nYou should see the message “Hello, (your name)” outputted to the terminal. Congratulations! No matter how simple, you’ve just programmed in Rust.\nThat’s it for this very bare bones introduction. The language has a lot of power and there are many concepts to learn and master. More to come in the future!\nResources:\nThe Rust Programming Language\nThe Cargo Book\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-05-baby-steps-with-rust/","title":"Baby Steps with Rust"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-09-constants/":{"body":"The journey to proficiency in Rust continues. In a previous article, I provided a brief overview of how to get started with Rust by creating a tiny cliche of a program that displays the message, “Hello, World!”.\nThis article will focus on a specific language aspect, namely constants.\nWhat is a Constant?\nA constant is a value that can be bound to a name, similar to a variable. By its nature, the value cannot change.\nWhat is the Purpose of a Constant?\nConstants are useful in any programming language because they help you avoid so-called “magic values”. A magic value is something that is hardcoded into the code base…likely in a million different locations, by the time all is said and done, which makes it impossible (or at least nasty) to properly update and change the code.\nInstead of hardcoded values, a handful of constants declared upfront make it clear and easy to update them later, should their values need to change.\nDeclaring Constants\nHere’s how to declare the speed of light (in metric) as a constant in Rust:\n\nFirst, the const keyword is used, followed by a name. The convention is all caps. Next, the constant must receive a type annotation, I’ve used a 32-bit unsigned integer type. The last step is to bind the value to the new constant with the = operator.\nScope of Validity\nConstants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, as such, they can be made widely available.\nOther Considerations\nAs one might expect, constants are immutable by default. Their values can’t be changed and you can’t use the mut keyword with them. A key concept in Rust is the notion that variables are immutable by default. One must expressly choose to make them mutable (changeable) by adding the keyword mut to the variable binding. Mut does not work with values that are constant.\nThanks for reading my short but sweet thoughts on contants in Rust.\nResources\nRust Programming Language: Common Programming Concepts, Constants\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-09-constants/","title":"Just Say No to Magic Values"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-12-pouring-the-footings/":{"body":"Before I continue in my series of articles on learning Rust, I’d like to remind you that I’m a random internet nobody. I’m far from an expert in this language and feel I have no right to be writing about anything to anyone most of the time. Learning to code is difficult and there are probably far better-informed experts to learn from than me. However, I have the tiny hope that sharing my journey will be beneficial to someone. There are precious few people writing about their experience with Rust. The act of writing about my learning process and the hurdles I overcome benefit me and I hope you do as well.\nEnough navel-gazing, let’s get on with some more foundational concepts in Rust. These building blocks are crucial. I know, speaking for myself, I’m in a terrible race to understand the higher-order concepts, because those are what make you able to build things other than toy software. The truth is that higher-order concepts are meaningless without solid footings to rest on. I’ve already written a short piece about Getting started with a Hello World app as well as a short piece on the advantages of Constants, so now I’ll turn to comments, variables, mutability, and shadowing.\nComments\nI’m going to start by asking you to take my advice because I’m not using it. I say that because I’m terrible at commenting on my code. Comments are important, don’t be like me. You should liberally comment on your code. Think of comments as bread crumbs to your future self. You could struggle for days on a particular piece of your program and if you’re diligent with commenting, you’ll have something to come back to later when faced with a similar problem. Comments are a great way to document the problem-solving process. Try to make them reflect the thinking in getting to the code, not so much what the code does.\nComments are prefaced with two slashes, like so:\n\nMulti-line comments are done like so:\n\nComments can go anywhere you like, but tend to be most useful right around what they’re commenting on.\n\nThere is a third type of comment, which powers as an aspect of the Rust that I find amazing. The third type is a documentation comment. It looks like this:\n\nI’ll write more about this down the road. If you want to read more now, head over to Publishing a Crate to Crates.io in the Rust Book.\nVariables, Mutability, and Shadowing\nAssigning Variables\nProgramming languages would be all but useless without variables. Variables allow the creation of programs that can accept a wide variety of input to do some action. In Rust, the act of creating a variable and giving it a value looks like this:\nlet album = “Attero Dominatus”;\nHere we bind a string slice (more about that in another article) to a variable named album, using the let keyword.\nImmutability of Variables\nIf you write some code that re-assigns the album variable later in your program, you’ll receive a compiler error that informs you that you can’t assign twice to the immutable variable ‘band’. A pillar of Rust is that variables are always immutable, meaning they can’t be changed after assignment. This protects you from a whole range of bugs involving variables that change when least expected. If a variable does need to change, then use the mut keyword to make it mutable.\n\nThis will allow you to change the value assigned to the variable band, if needed, elsewhere in the program. Default immutability is one of Rust’s terrific safety features and helps you protect yourself by making you think carefully about how and when variables need to be modified.\nShadowing of Variables\nRust allows one variable to be shadowed by another. Here’s an example:\n\nLet’s break it down…\n\nfirst, bind the value 5 to the variable named x\nsecond, shadow the value of x, take the original value (5) and add one\nthe value of x will be 6 and this gets printed to the console\n\nShadowing variables is a useful way to transform values from one type to another as well as perform operations on them. The variable is still immutable, even after the completion of any transformations.\nConclusion\nIn this article, I’ve hopefully given you some foundational breadcrumbs in the Rust language. Take these and go off to do your reading, research, and practice. As always, I recommend The Rust Programming Language for further reading and detail.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-12-pouring-the-footings/","title":"Pouring the Footings"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-14-pouring-the-footings-single/":{"body":"Today I continue my writing campaign about the Rust language. If you haven’t noticed, I’m roughly following the chapter layout of The Rust Programming Language, also known as “The Rust Book”. I’ve tried repeatedly to read The Book, but have concluded reading passively is useless. It’s a book that requires active reading.\nSo, I will semi-blog my way through it here on my site.\nI’ve covered the following basics so far:\n\ncreating a Hello, World\nuse of constants\nvariables, mutability, shadowing, and comments\nI’ll now turn to another basic language building block, data types. Data types are at the core of getting things done in Rust.\n\nThere are two broad data types available, single value and compound value. This article will focus on single value types. Compound value types are on deck as they deserve attention on their own.\nScalar Types\nSingle value data types represent one value, be it a number, character, or boolean. They are the simplest data types to work with and can be used in lots of ways and in combination with more complex data structures. Grouping these simple data types into structures, vectors, or hashmaps are typical use cases.\nIntegers\nAn integer is a number without a fractional component and can be signed or unsigned. There are several different maximum lengths of integers, chosen depending on the size of the number you need to represent. Rust defaults to an i32 or 32-bit integer.\nHere’s an example of an integer variable:\n\nWe’ve created a variable named life and bound the integer value 42 to it.\nFloating-Point\nA floating-point number has a decimal component. Rust supports 32-bit (f32) and 64-bit (f64) floating-point numbers. The default is f64. All floating-point numbers can be signed, there is no unsigned option like with integers.\nLet’s create a floating-point variable:\n\nWe’ve created a variable named pi and bound the floating-point value 3.14 to it.\nNumeric Operations\nRust supports all the basic mathematical operations that one would expect in a programming language. These are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There is also a remainder operation, which provides the remainder when one number is not cleanly divisible by the other.\nThe combined knowledge I’ve written about in my articles thus far allows us to write a tiny program to do math on integers or floating point numbers. Here’s one possiblity:\n\nLet’s walk through that:\n\ndeclare a main function as the starting point of the program\ncreate a variable named x and bind the integer value 5 to it\ncreate a variable named y and bind the integer value 6 to it\ncreate a variable named sum and use the addition operator to add x and y together and bind the result to the sum variable\nuse the println! macro to print out a message with our inputs and the sum\n\nBoolean\nIf you need a true or false value, a boolean is the data type of choice. Booleans are used a lot when controlling flow in a program. Here’s an example:\nlet liar_liar = true;\nWe’ve created a variable name liar_liar and bound the boolean value true to it.\nCharacter\nThe final simple single value is a character. Characters are bound to variable names like so:\n\nThe character data type can be used to hold emojis as well as traditional characters. It’s important to remember that character values represent a single character. You may be asking yourself about strings, what about them? Well, strings are a separate and distinct data type from characters. Strings carry many different quirks and just as The Book does, I’ll be treating them separately in the future.\nConclusion\nThe basic building blocks in Rust are pretty close to my ancient coding knowledge of a language called Pascal. As such, I’ve found them pretty easy to get acquainted with. This article has provided you with an overview of the basic, single value data types in Rust. These basic types can be composed in many different ways and are the core building blocks of any Rust program. Even advanced, higher-order stuff will have some basic math in it somewhere.\nThere are lots of subtleties to read about regarding the single value data types, I invite you to consult The Rust Book should you wish to learn more.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 3.2\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-14-pouring-the-footings-single/","title":"Pouring the Footings: Single Value Data Types"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-18-pouring-the-footings-compound/":{"body":"Selecting a data structure model is a key step in software development. Previously, I showed the very basic single data types in Rust. This article covers compound data types. Compound types can incorporate multiple building blocks in one overall type.\nTuples\nA tuple can contain multiple values, each with their own type, into one single entity. Tuples have a fixed length, they cannot grow or shrink later on. Tuples are stored on the stack in memory. Care is needed up front with creation because a tuples size can’t be modified later. You can modify the values inside the tuple, but new values can’t be added to it.\nWe can declare a tuple like so:\n\nWe’ve created a variable name called survey_result and bound a string slice (haven’t talked about strings yet, don’t worry for now), an integer, and a boolean together into a tuple. This variable could represent the data received after submission of a survey form. There are type annotations immediately following the variable name. These are optional. In most cases, Rust can “infer” (figure out) the types needed.\nThere are a couple of different ways to access the values inside a tuple.\nVia Indicies\nIndividual values inside a tuple are indexed from 0, 1, 2… similar to arrays or vectors. Values can be accessed with a (.) followed by the value index, like so:\n\nVia Destructuring\nThe index method is a little verbose and it can be difficult to track the indicies if the tuple is large. It’s more elegant (and efficient) to use the destructuring method, like so:\n\nWe’ve created the same tuple named survey_result and bound the same three values as the previous example. Next, we bind the individual values within the tuple to three new variables named name, age, and answer. We’ve used the destructuring pattern instead of three separate let statements. Finally, we print out the result to the console.\nTuples are useful for small data structures, but they become unwieldy for more complex needs. The better choice is a struct, which will be the topic of a future article.\nArrays\nThe next compound data type is an array. Similar to tuples, arrays are fixed length and cannot grow or shrink. Unlike tuples, arrays can only contain the same type of basic values. Arrays are useful in situations where a fixed number of elements is desired. An example array of the names of the days of the week can be created like so:\n\nI haven’t discussed memory yet as it relates to Rust, but similar to tuples, arrays are held in memory on the stack. This is because they are a known, fixed length, similar to the basic data types. Rust knows how much memory to allocate for them at compile time.\nArrays are declared with square brackets and can receive an optional type declaration, like so:\n\nWe’ve created an array of six integers and bound it to the variable named numbers. The type declaration is enclosed in square brackets and contains the type followed by a semicolon and the number of elements in the array.\nIf for some reason an array is needed that initially has all the same elements, a short form can be used to declare it, like so:\n\nThis creates an array with three elements, all having the integer value 3.\nElements within an array are accessed by referencing the variable name and appending an index surrounded with square brackets, like so:\n\nHere we declare an array variable that contains the five days of the week. Individual elements are indexed from 0 to 4. We then assign Wednesday to a new variable called midweek and Friday to a new variable called endofweek.\nIt’s important to remember the 0 start index of an array. I messed up while writing this 🙂 I think whoever decided to start indexing at zero should have their head examined, but it is what it is.\nTo conclude the discussion on arrays, Rust will help you when accessing array elements by automatically checking that the specified index is less than the array’s length. A runtime error will be received in the event the program tries to access an array index that is beyond the end of the array.\nConclusion\nThis article has covered Rust’s compound data types, tuples and arrays. I haven’t seen or written giant amounts of Rust code yet, but I’ve not seen these data structures used particularly often. The go-to seems to be vectors, particularly vectors of structs. The potential unwieldiness of tuples and the inability of arrays to grow or shrink I think limits their use cases. They both have the advantage of being stored on the stack in memory, so they are cheap to make and quick to access. At the end of the day, both are an available tool and you the programmer must choose what works best for your particular problem.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 3.2\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-18-pouring-the-footings-compound/","title":"Pouring the Footings: Compound Data Types"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-22-lets-get-functional/":{"body":"In my last Rusty writings, I covered Rust’s compound data types. Today I will write to you about functions. Functions are essential tool to help make code more organized and maintainable.\nPurpose\nI’m sure you are familiar with the term spaghetti code, in which your code is a nested mess of twisted logic. Functions are a partial solution to this as they encourage modularity and can make your code base more understandable. Common tasks can be moved to separate blocks of code, then called upon by the main program when needed.\nSyntax\nWe’re already familiar with one function in Rust, the main function. It serves as the entry point to your program. Every Rust binary program has one.\n\nA function is declared with the fn keyword followed by the function name. Immediately after the name are brackets to contain possible parameters. Then, if the function is to return a value, the → syntax is used with a type declaration. Lastly, we have curly braces denoting the beginning of the code block comprising the function.\nFunctions in Rust uses the so called snake case as the naming convention. The snake case consists of two or more lower case words separated by an underscore.\nLet’s try it:\n\nWhat have we done here?\n\ndeclared a new function called remaining_lyrics\nthe function accepts no parameters and doesn’t return anything\nthe function uses the println! macro to print out a message to the terminal\ndeclared a main function\nthe main function prints out a message to the terminal\nthe remaining_lyrics function is called to finish the message\n\nOne item of note is I’ve declared the function first before the main function. This is just a choice on my part. Historically I’ve always liked declaring my functions first, then having the main function as the very last thing. This is just a personal preference.\nParameters\nFunctions can accept values, also known as parameters, on which to do further operations. Parameters are sometimes referred to as arguments. You may see these terms used interchangeably in your coding travels. I will try to be consistent going forward and refer to them as parameters.\nLet’s adapt our snippet above to use some parameters:\n\nWe’ve now made our remaining_lyrics function accept 3 string slices as parameters. It accepts these string slices when they are passed from the main program by placing them inside brackets right after the function call. The output is the same, but now we have Metallica, Reload, and Fuel printed after the lyrics.\nAn essential thing about using parameters in functions: the type of the parameter must be annotated to the parameter name. In our little music example, the &amp;str type has been annotated. Failing to annotate the type will result in a compiler error.\nReturn Values\nFunctions can not only receive parameters and process them. Functions can return values back to where they are called from. Let’s make a program which prints a message to tell us the year of release of a very famous album by a favourite band:\n\nHere, the main function prints out a simple message, but calls the function year_released(), which accepts no parameters, and simply returns an integer. This example serves to illustrate an important concept, beyond just the notion of returning a value, the difference between statements and expressions.\nExpressions vs Statements\nRust functions are made up of statements and expressions. Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. An example is the println! statement in the remaining_lyrics function above. It performs the action of printing out a message. Expressions evaluate out to a value. This is what happens in our example above of returning a value. The year_released() function has a single expression which evaluates to an integer.\n\n\nStatements are terminated with semi-colons.\n\n\nExpressions are not terminated with semi-colons.\n\n\nUse of the return keyword at the end of a function is optional in Rust. There are times when it’s beneficial to use the return keyword, such as in the instance of an early return out of a function.\nConclusion\nThis article has covered the basics of functions in Rust. It’s shown you the syntax as well as explained the ability of functions to accept optional parameters and return values. Functions are the bread and butter of Rust and provide a means of keeping your code concise, tidy, and maintainable. In my own journey to learn Rust, I’ve found functions relatively easy to understand, as their structure is almost identical to other languages I have familiarity with, namely C and Turbo Pascal (wow, I’m old). I hope you’ve enjoyed this short article on functions. Next up will be decision making and flow control. See you next time!\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 3.3\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-22-lets-get-functional/","title":"Let's Get Functional"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-23-pillars/":{"body":"There is so much pressure to build and develop faster, faster, faster. The result of the rush is a creation that can’t carry its own weight and buckles under pressure. It’s important to master the pillars of web development. Effort to master the pillars will reward you with skills that stand the test of time as well as creations that users will enjoy.\nI’m an engineer and I work in the construction industry. I see many parallels between constructing a building and constructing a website. On my own journey to learn web development, I’ve flitted between shiny frameworks, but have come to see there are four pillars…foundation, structure, form, and power. Not being intimate with each of them puts any skills with a framework on shaky ground.\nFoundation — Separation of Concerns\nEvery building needs to rest on stable soil, have solid footings, and sound structure to support itself and its occupants. A website is no different. Set up a clean folder structure and have separate files. HTML should be on its own, CSS should be on its own and properly referenced from your HTML files. JavaScript should be on its own and properly reference from your HTML files. Separating things out serves three purposes, it makes code easier to debug and maintain, it makes it understandable by others, and it makes the web site function efficiently. Attention spans are ever shorter, long load times will cause readers to move on to the next thing. The choices made in laying out the site will have a significant impact on performance.\nStructure — HTML\nSolid HTML is the next important piece. HTML is the skeleton, keeping everything upright. It’s the floors and shear walls. If you do it right, your site will function and be useful to someone on an enormous range of devices, some of which may not have a screen. A key point is that HTML should explain what the elements of the site ARE (or should be), not what they should look like…that’s the job of CSS. Spend some time laying out your information and give it good structure. You’ll have a solid fallback.\nForm — CSS\nCSS breathes life into the HTML skeleton. Like the exterior envelope of a building, it gives form, colour and shape. Responsive design principles are brought in through CSS. There’s a lot of beauty that can be brought to bear with CSS on its own. Take some time to learn its nuances thoroughly and gain appreciation for its capabilities. Don’t use HTML where you should be leveraging CSS to create the look and feel you want.\nPower — Javascript\nThe addition of some JavaScript gives a site functionality and juices it with power which enables users to get things done. If you’ve setup the structure and form correctly, JavaScript adds spice and that little “something” that puts the site over the top. JavaScript should be used sparingly. Most of the functionality of a site should come from proper design of the layout with HTML and design of styling with CSS.\nConclusion\nThere’s a rush today that makes everything frantic and borderline unsustainable. The rush, when applied to web design, can result in products which are difficult to maintain and perform poorly for their intended audience. Take your time, smell the flowers, and make sure your creation has a solid footing with the pillars of web technology.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-23-pillars/","title":"Pillars"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-27-decisions-decisions/":{"body":"Software capability would be very limited if there were no ability to make decisions and follow different logic paths. The ability to branch and provide different outcomes, based on either internal results or external user input, is essential. Rust provides basic decision logic in the form of the if and else if expressions.\nThe if Expression\nAn if expression starts with the if keyword and is followed by a condition. Immediately after the condition is a block of code, surrounded by curly braces, which is executed if the condition proves true. If the condition is not true, the code after the condition is skipped entirely and execution flows to the next statement.\nLet’s see an example:\n\nWe first declare a variable named year and bind to it the integer 1984. Next, we start the if expression. The condition checks that the value bound to the year variable is greater than 2000. In this instance, it is not, so the code in the curly braces is ignored and the program ends. Nothing is output.\nIf the condition was true, then the code within the curly braces would execute and we’d see the message “The years is: 1984” output to the console.\nConditions can be chained with operators like or || and &amp;&amp;. This provides the ability to make decisions with more complex criteria.\n\nThe condition in this code will evaluate true if the year is greater than 2000 and less than 2025. Our year variable has a value of 2022, which satisfies both conditions. The code block after the condition will execute and the message “The year is: 2022” will output to the console.\nWhen the condition after an if statement is not satisfied, code execution jumps to whatever comes after the if expression. An optional else expression can be added to provide another pathway for code to follow. The code preceding the else statement will execute only when the condition evaluates to false.\n\nHere, we declare a variable named number and bind to it the value 26. We check if the value assigned to number is greater than 30. In this case, it is not, so execution transfers to the else expression and the code within the curly brackets preceding it is executed. The message “26 is less than 30” is printed to the console.\nIf the variable year contained a value that was greater than 30, the code preceding the condition is executed instead, resulting in a different message being output to the console. In this case, the else expression would be skipped and code flow would proceed to whatever comes after.\nThe else…if Expression\nIf there is a need to check multiple conditions, the else if expression is available. Let’s take the example given in Chapter 3.5 of The Rust Programming Language, as it illustrates an important nuance.\n\nWe bind the integer 6 to the variable named number. We then have a list of conditions to check. Rust will execute the first block of code for which a condition is satisfied, which in this case is the first else expression. The number six is evenly divisible by 3, so the message “number is divisible by 3” is output to the console. Even though some of the other conditions in the series may be true, it doesn’t matter. Only the first true one is executed, all the other possibilities are ignored.\nNested if else if expressions can get out of hand very quickly resulting in messy code that’s hard to reason through. Rust has a more advanced option, the match statement, which is very powerful. I’ll explore it in future writings.\nUsing if in a let Statement\nGiven if is an expression, it can form part of a let statement and be used to assign variables. Again, an example from The Rust Programming language is useful.\n\nHere, we bind the boolean value true to a variable named condition. Next, the integer 5 is bound to the variable number. This happens because the variable condition is true. An if statement, fundamentally, is checking whether something is true, then executing code after. The else part of the expression is ignored. If the condition was false instead of true, the integer 6 would be bound to number.\nConclusion\nI’ve shown you Rust’s most basic tools for coding decision-making. The combination of if, else, and else if provide the ability for different code paths to execute, thus varying the output as needed based on internal conditions or a combination of internal conditions and external input.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 3.5\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-04-27-decisions-decisions/","title":"Decisions Decisions"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-05-01-controlling-the-flow/":{"body":"Last time, in Decisions, Decisions, we looked at a method for adding logic within a program, via the if and if else expressions. Next up, we see how we can further control the flow, through loops. Loops allow repetition of blocks of code until some desired event or outcome. There are three kinds of loops in Rust: loop, while, and for.\nloop\nThe loop keyword tells Rust to execute the same block of code over, and over, and over again, until told specifically to stop. Here’s a basic example:\n\nThis program will endlessly print out the message, “Help, I’m stuck in a loop!”, over and over to the console until you hit the control-C key combo to break out. This is not particularly elegant or useful. Luckily, you can control how long you stay in the loop.\nHere’s another example:\n\nWe declare a counter variable and bind the starting value of 10 to it. Then, we enter a loop. In the loop, we iterate through the following steps:\n\nprint a message about being stuck in a loop\ndecrease the counter value by one\ncheck if the counter is less than zero, if it is, we print one final message then break out of the loop, terminating the program\nif the counter is not less than zero, around we go again\n\nValues can be returned out of loops. This is useful in the case where you might be computing something, then need to return the value out to the rest of the program. When doing this, the loop can be assigned to a variable, which will hold the result computed from the loop. Here’s an example:\n\nHere, you can see that we’ve added the final result of the counter variable to the break keyword, then bound the whole loop structure to the variable result.\nwhile\nFrequently, we need to repeat an action while a certain condition is true. Without any other methods, we could do this with a combination of the loop we just learned about, along with if, else, and break, however, this is cumbersome. Rust has the while loop for us.\nHere’s an example:\n\nWe declare a variable named number and bind the value 10 to it, when we enter the while loop, checking that number is not equal to 0. We print a message with the value of number, decreasing it by 1 on each pass through the loop. Eventually, we reach 0 and the final message is output.\nfor\nThe last basic loop structure is a for loop. In a for loop, execution happens for as many times as you specify. Any other decision logic you have to add yourself. The for loop will execute the specified number of times, in absence of anything else.\nLet’s say we have a couple of arrays and we need to print out all the elements within each. We can do that with a for loop.\n\nThis will loop through the individual entries in each array, and print the entries to the console.\nA handy thing to do with for loops is to pull in Range from the standard library AND use the rev method available on Range to countdown. Let’s do another countdown using this technique:\n\nThis is quite elegant.\nConclusion\nThese loops, when combined with decision logic such as if and else if, allow programs to have a more sophisticated execution order and be more flexible to internal and external input. These basic building blocks form the basis of all you do with Rust going forward. When combined with Rust’s more advanced features and data structures, you’re able to create truly useful software. My writings up to this point have covered the very basic programming concepts included in Rust. Before I move on to the more advanced territory from the Rust Book, in my next article I’ll demonstrate building something simple with all that I’ve written about so far. Stay tuned!\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 3.5\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-05-01-controlling-the-flow/","title":"Controlling the Flow"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-05-04-building-something-saying-hello/":{"body":"I’ve covered what I consider the core concepts of the Rust language, namely:\n\nconstants\ncomments, variables, mutability and shadowing\nsimple data types\ncompound data types\nfunctions\ndecision making\nflow control\nFrom this core, useful things can arise. Let’s build something.\n\nIn my Let the Journey Begin piece, I showed you how to create the classic coding journey starting point, a hello world program. That little grain of salt didn’t take any user input. We shall write a program which asks for your name and then prints to the console a simple greeting.\nHere’s what the output will be:\n\nThere are a few important concepts that will bubble up from this simple example. You’ll learn how to use Rust’s standard library as well as how to “sanitize” or clean up input received from a user. We’ll also take the opportunity to incorporate modularity by breaking the program up into distinct parts, each with a specific purpose.\nProblem Statement\nThe “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn to write in many languages but doesn’t typically involve any input. Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.\nConstraints\nWe’ll impose some constraints on our solution and exercise the principle of “separation of concerns” to make our program modular. We’ll structure our program into separate functions to keep the input, string building, and output jobs separate.\nWalkthrough\nI’m terrible for just jumping in and coding, without solving the problem or outlining my program structure. I vow to help you be better. Let’s think for a minute about what we need to do.\n\nask for the user’s name\n“sanitize” the user’s input, as it will contain white space (a carriage return) that will affect our output format\nbuild the greeting string from three parts, including the input received\noutput the result\n\nFunction to get the name\n\nFirst up is our get_name function. It doesn’t need to take any parameters and must return a string to the next part of our program. We use the print! macro to output the text “What is your name?” and then wait for input. We haven’t used println! because we don’t want a carriage return. We need to pose the question, then wait for the user to type it all on the same line.\nNext, we declare a variable named buffer, which is made mutable so that we can receive the input and store it. We take the user’s typed name, store it in our mutable buffer variable, and then the function ends and we return the name as a string.\nYou’ll notice the .unwrap() method. I’ve not explained this yet, but will in the future. There’s a good preview here at Rust by Example. The read_line method might fail, in that it might not return a result. The use of .unwrap() says we’ll ignore the possible error and assume we get the result we need. The program will panic and crash if we don’t get the name as an input.\nThere is a concept glossed over. The use of the print! macro carries with it the need to force out our text of the request to enter your name, as it may not be emitted immediately. We use the .flush() method on io::stdout() to achieve this. Similar to the use of the read_line method, we .unwrap() the result and ignore the potential for errors.\nFunction to build the greeting message\n\nIn the build_greeting function, the main work happens. This function needs a parameter, namely the name string we just received from the get_name function. A string (the complete greeting) will be returned. We declare a mutable variable (an owned string…haven’t talked about what ownership means yet, but it’s coming soon). We use the push_str method to append our name variable and we use the trim() method to trim off any carriage returns received as part of the name variable. This action serves to “sanitize” the user input. Then, we append the last part of the greeting, once again using the push_str method. Finally, we return the completed greeting.\nFunction to print the greeting to the console\n\nOur final function, print_greeting, receives our greeting string as a parameter and uses the println! macro to output it to the console.\nFinal Code\nLet’s put it all together.\n\nThe very beginning of our program has a use statement. We need to use some things from Rust’s standard library (stdin and stdout, along with their associated methods), to aid in getting our input, and we need to bring them “into scope” so that our program can find and use them.\nThe main function calls the three functions in a nested fashion, with the result being our greeting to the user. In this nested function call, it’s important to remember that the get_name function returns the name, which serves as the parameter that the build_greeting function needs. Lastly, the greeting string returned from build_greeting serves as the parameter that print_greeting needs to print the greeting.\nConclusion\nI’ve shown you a step-by-step methodology for creating a program which asks for user input in the form of your name, builds a greeting using by combining the name with a pre-built string, and outputs the result to the console. This program is simple but surfaces several subtleties that are useful going forward and act as building blocks to the creation of bigger and better things. It’s critical to imagine the flow of data through your program and the act of working through a problem with a simple solution helps sharpen your ability.\nGitHub Repo\nI’ve put the code into a GitHub repo, you can access it here:\n57-exercises: Say-Hello\nReferences\nExercises for Programmers: 57 Exercises to Challenge your Programming Skills, by Brian P.

The next topic is ownership and borrowing, but I don’t feel like I’m quite able to write about those two things coherently yet. Instead, I will write about the first of Rust’s bigger building blocks — structs.\nWhat is a Struct?\nA struct is a flexible data structure that allows creation of different data fields within one group. Structs are similar to tuples but more flexible. Each data field is named and can be accessed directly. There is no need to rely on the order of the data in a struct. Named fields serve to make it more clear the overall purpose and details embodied by the struct.\nHow Do I Construct a Struct?\nLet’s look at how we construct a struct (see what I did there…):\n\nWe create a struct by using the struct keyword immediately followed by a name. Convention is to make struct names capitalized. We then surround the individual fields with curly braces. The fields of the struct are created with key: value pairs separated by commas. The example here contains predominately string types, with a lone 32 bit unsigned integer. Struct fields can be of any type.\nI will highlight one side topic here. The majority of the fields in our struct are Strings, in this case we’ve made them owned strings, meaning our struct will have ownership of all its data. More on ownership will come in a future article.\nHow Do I Use a Struct?\nIt’s important to remember that all we’ve done so far is create the template for a struct. The template has a name, Album, as well as several empty fields. This is a blueprint, if you will, of our data structure. To actually make it useful, we have to add flesh the bones.\nWe do that like so:\n\nLet’s unpack this.\nWe’ve started our program (with the main function) and immediately declare a variable called album1. This variable is our first “instance” of our Album struct. Inside the curly braces we assign specific values to the data fields that are unique to the album1 variable.\nIt’s important to note that, as declared in this example, the fields cannot be modified. To modify one or more of them the mut keyword is needed as part of the variable declaration.\n\nThis change now lets us re-assign values to the fields of the struct, as illustrated by the reassignment of two of the fields immediately after the variable declaration.\nHow do we access the fields inside a struct?\nLike so:\n\nWe call the name of the struct variable, then use dot notation and append the name of the field we want to work with. In this case, we’re outputting the album1 name field to the console using the println! macro.\nConclusion\nStructs are a powerful and often used data structure in Rust. They are a core part of the type system that makes Rust so flexible. In this article I’ve shown you how to create, populate, and use fields inside a struct. There are more things to talk about for structs, but I’ll save those for a future “advanced” article.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Defining and Instantiating Structs\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-05-11-bigger-building-blocks-intro-to-structs/","title":"Bigger Building Blocks: Intro to Structs"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-05-21-bigger-building-blocks-intro-to-enumerations/":{"body":"Today I will cover the very basics of Rust’s enum type. Enums are a pillar of the language.\nWhat is an Enumeration?\nAn enumeration, or enum, is a type of data structure useful for enumerating possible variants of something. In addition, enums can optionally contain data. Enums are best to describe variations of one particular thing. They differ from structs, as structs can contain multiple things all grouped under one category.\nHow Do I Create an Enumeration?\nLet’s say we needed a data structure to define several possible variants of peppers. We can do it with an enum:\n\nI’ve now defined a custom type that can be used throughout the rest of a program.\nEnums can also contain data. Data can be attached directly, without the need for another data structure. We can embody some data about spiciness, by adding the Scoville Heat Unit rating, right into the enum variants, like so:\n\nWe’ve added an integer data type with each of our peppers so that we can later add in a Scoville Heat Unit value. Each element in an enum can be assigned different quantities and types of data. There is no limitation on the number of variations an enum can contain. I’ve kept it simple for the purposes of this article.\nHow Do I Use an Enumeration?\nLet’s see how we can use our Pepper enum.\n\nHere, we declare two variables, sweet and spicy, and assign them the types we declared in our Pepper enum. We also assign an integer to embody the Scoville Heat Unit rating.\nTo access the data contained in our Pepper enums, we have to use the match keyword. I’ve not introduced match yet in my writing, so consider this the first glimpse. I will write more in-depth on it in a future article.\n\nThis program will result in the following output to the terminal:\n\nThe match keyword in Rust can be used as a sort of flow control, evaluating all possible options of an enum and providing a custom code path to execute for each one. It’s important, when writing match expressions, that ALL possible variants of an enum must be accounted for. If you don’t, you’ll get a compiler error.\nLet’s break down what we did above.\nWe create a match expression first for the sweet pepper variable we declared earlier. We access the data inside the bell pepper variant by declaring a new variable called shu, to represent the Scoville Heat Unit. The first “arm” of our match will result in the output of a simple statement printed to the console, including the value of the Scoville Heat Unit rating. The second, empty match arm is needed because the enum might not contain a value. Remember that all possible variations must be accounted for. In this case, we simply want to do nothing, hence the use of the unit type (), which returns nothing but satisfies the need to deal with all possible variants. In this made-up code sample, our Pepper enum always contains a value, so after execution of our first match arm, code execution continues on to the spicy pepper case.\nWe write a second match expression, structured similarly, for our spicy pepper, which outputs its Scoville Heat Unit rating.\nConclusion\nI’ve shown you the very bare bones of Rust’s enum structure, which is useful to create custom data types. Enum’s can optionally contain data, increasing their flexibility. The match keyword is used to access internal data within an enum and use it or take other action based on the internal data. Enums are a core part of the powerful type system in Rust.\nThere are two special versions of the enum type, Option and Result, which contribute to Rust’s robust error handling ability. I will cover these in a future article.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 6.1.Defining an Enum\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-05-21-bigger-building-blocks-intro-to-enumerations/","title":"Bigger Building Blocks: Intro to Enumerations"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-06-11-bigger-building-blocks-structs-reloaded/":{"body":"In a previous article, I introduced you to structs in Rust. Structs are flexible data structures that allow the grouping of fields together under one roof. Structs have a lot of capability. Let’s take a look at the things I didn’t cover last time out.\nThe Field Init Shorthand\nThe fields of a struct can be initialized quickly by using the field init shorthand. Let’s see this through an example.\nWe’ll start by defining a struct to hold information about photos. Our struct will contain fields for an identifier, the date the photo was taken, the time the photo was taken, and the location the photo was taken:\n\nNext, we build a function that’s used to create and return our Photo struct with information in its fields:\n\nThis function fills in the id and date fields of the Photo struct by using the id and date parameters received from the function. Because the struct fields have the same names as the incoming parameters of the function, they are automatically populated. We choose to initialize the other two fields manually, but there’s no reason why the function couldn’t have as many parameters as the struct fields. In this case, all of them would be automatically initialized.\nThe Update Syntax\nIt’s frequently useful to create an instance of a struct by copying data from another one. There’s a nice shorthand to achieve this, called the struct update syntax.\n\nIn this snip, we’re declaring a new variable called photo2, and then initializing it with all the fields from a previously declared photo1 variable, but changing the date field to have new data.\nTuple Structs without Named Fields\nStructs don’t necessarily need their fields spelled out. We can combine them with the tuple data structure. Let’s say we need to represent a position in space. This can be done with three coordinates, typically noted as x, y, and z.\n\nHere, we declare a tuple struct that contains three integers to represent our x, y, and z coordinates. This struct can then be used to contain position data, like so:\n\nThe data inside tuple structs can be accessed using dot notation and the positions of the particular fields. Our Coordinates struct has three fields, so you could do this to access the individual data points:\n\nTuple structs are best for containing small quantities of fields where it’s easy to remember their purpose. If you need more than say two or three fields, it’s probably better to use a struct with named fields.\nTuple structs form their own type, even though the fields within two tuple structs might be the same. You can’t mix and match two different tuple structs together.\nUnit Structs with No Fields\nStructs do not need to contain data. They can be made into “unit structs”. Rust has a concept known as the “unit type”, which is denoted by round brackets with nothing inside, (). Let’s take a look at the example used in the Rust Book:\n\nWe declare our struct using the name AlwaysEqual. There’s no need to explicitly write empty brackets, we can just terminate our declaration with a semicolon. Then, in our main function, we declare an instance of our AlwaysEqual type by binding it to a variable named subject.\nStructs created in this manner are most useful when creating Traits, which will come in a future article. Traits are a way of defining common behaviour and are a powerful piece of the Rust puzzle.\nConclusion\nTo recap, in this article I’ve shown you the remaining concepts that make structs an important part of the Rust language. I’ve covered shortcuts for initializing data and updating the information within a struct. I’ve also covered the notion of tuple structs, useful for small amounts of data where named fields aren’t a necessity. Lastly, I touched on the notion of unit structs that have no data but instead can be used to represent a type.\nReferences\nChapter 5.2, Defining and Instantiating Structs\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-06-11-bigger-building-blocks-structs-reloaded/","title":"Bigger Building Blocks: Structs Reloaded"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-07-01-method-to-the-madness/":{"body":"The Method Syntax\nI’m going to turn my attention now to something called the method syntax. It’s common to structs and enums, which I’ve covered in previous outings.\nStructs and enums can have methods associated with them. This enables custom functionality to be implemented.\nLet’s do this discussion with the help of an example.\nA Circle Calculator\nHere is a Rust program which will help us calculate the key characteristics of a circle, namely its area, diameter, and circumference. Respectively, these characteristics are:\n\narea: the amount of space inside the circle, the equation for calculating the area is: A = pi x r²\ndiameter: the “width” of the circle, the equation for calculating the diameter is: D = 2 x r\ncircumference: the distance around the circle, the equation for calculating the circumference is: C = 2 x pi x r\nr is the radius of the circle and pi is the Archimedes’ constant which is 3.14\n\n\nWe need the constant pi, which is available to us in Rust’s standard library, so we pull this in as a dependency with a use statement. Next, we declare a typle struct called Circle. This tuple struct contains one value, a 32-bit floating-point number which represents the radius. Next, we get to the meat of the matter. Structs can have methods defined for them, which allow you to write code to do something with the struct. Methods are started with the impl keyword, followed by a name which must match the name of the struct. Inside the curly braces, we define one or more functions which comprise our “implementation block” for the Circle struct. Everything inside this block is associated with the Circle struct.\nThe first function, called area, takes a reference to the struct itself as a parameter (still haven’t talked about references and borrowing yet…I will get there, I promise) and returns the area of the circle. The equation I gave above for area is used. To access the radius value contained within our struct, we use self.0 to reference it. It’s important to note that Methods must take self as their first parameter. The can have other parameters, but self is always the first.\nThe diameter and circumference functions perform a similar task, taking the radius provided as part of the struct, using the equations I noted earlier, and returning the diameter and circumference.\nThe main function ends up being very lean, given we’ve implemented most of the program through the methods on the Circle struct. We declare an instance of our Circle struct, called circle1, and give it a radius value of 15.0 metres. Then, we calculate and output our results by calling, in turn, each of the methods we created. Methods are called by simply appending the method’s name to the struct variable, using dot notation.\nThe output from this program will be:\n\nI’ll leave you to embellish this program with things like user input, maybe from command line arguments using the clap crate or whatever other way you choose. You could also fancy up the output if you like.\nConclusion\nI’ve presented the method syntax to you with a simple, practical example. Methods are a means of providing encapsulation and organization to your Rust programs. They enable the selective exposure of functionality to users as well as other parts of the program. Everything related to Circles is in one place, making it straightforward to know how to interact with the program.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 5.3, Method Syntax\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-07-01-method-to-the-madness/","title":"Method to the Madness"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-07-14-the-memory-doesnt-remain/":{"body":"\n\"Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane...but the memory remains!\" - Metallica, The Memory Remains\n\nThis is the article I’ve been needing to write for about a month (maybe two) but have fretted and procrastinated.\nMemory, ownership, borrowing…oh my!\nThese concepts are probably the most difficult things in Rust. I worry that I’m not doing these topics justice. However, I’m going to shove this worry aside and just go for it. I intend on returning to this article periodically to update it as my understanding improves.\nIf you never start, you never finish, so here we go…\nDealing with Garbage\nIn programming languages, there are two broad approaches to handling the use and cleanup of memory.\nThe first is manual, as in it’s all on you the programmer. An example is the C language. The C compiler leaves memory use entirely up to you. If you forget to free memory after you’ve finished with it, an error may result because the C compiler is blissfully unaware. More than likely, you’ll be dealing with the consequences later.\nThe second is so-called garbage collection. Languages such as JavaScript use a built-in memory manager, called a garbage collector, that follows along behind you to clean up memory. This brings overhead, which may be unacceptable for resource-constrained systems.\nRust introduces a third way. The Rust compiler brings a set of rules that are checked at compile time. Code will not compile if any of the rules are broken. The rules do not impact the performance of your program because they are enforced at compile time.\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty of this seemingly magical system, there are a couple of other general concepts to review.\nThe Stack vs. The Heap\nLike C, Rust works within the same two memory regions, the stack and the heap.\nThe Stack\nAnytime you create a variable using Rust’s simple types, like an integer, the variable is created on a region of memory known as the stack. Things that go on the stack have to be fixed in size and can’t change. Fresh data is always stored at the top of the stack. Storing on the stack is quick. I recommend the ownership chapter of the Rust Book, which provides a good overview of the stack.\nThe Heap\nThe heap is a dynamic area of memory that can grow and shrink as needed. When data is placed in the heap, the memory allocator finds a contiguous block of space and returns a reference called a pointer. Accessing memory on the heap is slower than on the stack, because, in effect, it needs to be looked up first. I recommend the ownership chapter of the Rust Book, which serves as a good overview of the heap.\nOwnership and Scope\nRust has three rules of ownership:\n\nEach Rust value has a variable called its “owner”.\nEach value can have only one owner at a time.\nWhen the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\n\nTo begin thinking about ownership, it’s essential to think about scope. A scope is denoted by curly braces. Here’s an example:\n\nWe declare a string literal and bind it to a variable called fuel. Variable fuel comes into scope as it’s declared. We can do what we need with it right up until the closing curly brace. Past that point, Rust calls a special internal drop function to clean up the trash. The memory that our fuel variable used is freed up.\nAny variable in the Rust language is valid when it comes into scope and it remains valid until it goes out of scope. The compiler will throw an error if you attempt to access the value in a variable that has gone out of scope.\nA consequence of this notion of validity until the scope ends, where functions are concerned, is that we have to pass in AND pass back anything that we want to use later. If we don’t the values will be lost.\n\nHere, we declare a variable called fuel and bind the same string literal as above to it. We then declare a tuple, consisting of a new string variable and an integer (to represent the string length that we’re going to determine) and we bind to the tuple returned by the function calculate length. We pass in our fuel variable to this function.\nThe function takes our passed string and returns it along with its length. The len() method is used on our passed-in string to determine the length. We finally print the string and its length to the console.\nThis is a lot of work. We need to do a lot of moving and passing around values to make sure we don’t lose them due to variables going out of scope. Fortunately, we’re saved by the notions of references and borrowing.\nReferences and Borrowing\nThe second pillar of Rust memory management is the notion of a reference. We can use values owned by other variables without claiming ownership. This is called borrowing.\nWhat if we could simply reference values in variables without taking ownership of them? Let’s revisit our previous example.\n\nThis code may not seem simpler, but it is. We declare a string variable and give it a value as before. Next, we call a function to get the string length, but this time we pass in a reference to our fuel variable. The &amp; represents a reference, allowing us to refer to a value without taking ownership of it.\nYou’ll notice the function signature simplifies as it now takes a reference to a string and returns a usize, which is basically an integer. Inside the function, we again get the length of the string using the len() method.\nWe have just borrowed the value of another variable to do something with it.\nYou’ll note here that we don’t need to return the value from the function calculate_length, to give back ownership, because change never had ownership in the first place.\nMutability and Borrowing\nReferences are immutable by default. We can’t change the value of something we don’t own. To change the value referenced, we have to use a mutable borrow. Let’s look at an example:\n\nWe declare a mutable variable called string and we bind our favourite song lyrics to it. The fuel variable can change because we made it mutable. Next, we call a function called to change and pass it a mutable reference to our fuel variable. Ownership will not be transferred, and the value of fuel will not be moved to the function, because we are simply borrowing this variable. The change function takes a string as a parameter, which is annotated as a reference to a mutable String. The function body appends some text to the string to complete our song lyrics. Once again, the function makes our change but does not have to pass anything back.\nConclusion\nThe concepts of ownership and borrowing are difficult to get used to. There is a lot of so-called “fighting the borrow checker” which comes with the early days of learning in Rust. However, over time the concepts do become relatively intuitive. Rust’s rules of ownership combine to make Rust’s code inherently safe, performant and free of the issues that plague languages like C. The compiler checks for us, giving us confidence that our code is, out of the gate, safe and trustworthy.\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 4.1, What is Ownership?\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 4.2, References and Borrowing\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-07-14-the-memory-doesnt-remain/","title":"The Memory Doesn't Remain"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-08-13-option-is-it-something-or-nothing/":{"body":"I apologize, dear readers, for my lack of consistency in posting here on Medium. Writing and generating content is a challenge for me. If I can provide you with a nugget of perspective once a month, that’s what I’m going to aim for. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, so eventually, you might see more from me. I thank all of you for your interest in reading my thoughts on the Rust language.\nIn an earlier article, I introduced the notion of enumerations, or enums, that are useful to represent types in Rust. You’ll also recall that Enums can optionally contain data. It’s time to introduce one of two special Rust enums…the Option type. Today I give you a short bite on this topic.\nAn Option can contain something and or it can contain nothing. It’s a little like Schrödinger's Cat, it might be alive (contains something) or it might be dead (contains nothing) and you don’t know until you check. Let’s dive in.\nAn Option looks like this:\n\nThe None variant is used when the option holds nothing, no data. The Some variant can contain something. The  is the notation for a generic type parameter. I haven’t covered generics yet, but their nuts and bolts are not super important for this discussion. In the context of the Option enum, it means a data type of any kind. It could, for example, contain a single integer.\nThe Option enum provides a graceful way to implement a null value. The notion of a null value has wreaked havoc on the computing world, to say the least.\nThis Option concept is best illustrated with an example. Consider this program which takes two numbers, tries to divide them, and provides the result:\n\nThis program has a main function and a function called divide. In the main function, we declare two floating point numbers as the numerator and denominator variables, then we pass them to the divide function and assign the answer to the variable result. The divide function accepts two floating point parameters, the numerator and the denominator. It returns an option, which will either be a floating point number or nothing. The function checks if the denominator is zero, if it is, our returned option is assigned None as its value. If the denominator is non-zero, our math can proceed and our option will return the calculation result.\nBack inside the main program, with the result in hand, we run a match expression on it and output the answer. If our option contains something we output the result of the calculation. If our option contains nothing, we output a message stating that you can’t divide by zero.\nThe option type is almost always combined with a match expression for further processing.\nOption is a flexible and versatile construct in the Rust language. It is often used for:\n\ninitial values\noptional function arguments\nswapping things out of difficult situations\nbasic error handling, where None is returned and perhaps combined with a message to represent the error\n\nThe Rust standard library documentation has a good in-depth description of the option type. I recommend you read it for the full scoop.\nIn a future article, I’ll go through the Result type, which is the second special enum type built into the Rust language. Thanks for reading!\nReferences:\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 6.1, Defining an Enum\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-08-13-option-is-it-something-or-nothing/","title":"Is it Something or Nothing: The Option Type"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-09-30-matchy-matchy/":{"body":"My journey in learning the Rust language continues. Today, let’s explore one of Rust’s unique methods of controlling program flow, known as the match construct. The match syntax is really addictive, and sorely missed when you use other languages.\nPreviously, I’ve explored the traditional ways of controlling program flow, namely if..else and looping. Rust has another way, the match construct, which allows your code to evaluate and act on multiple possibilities.\nLet’s dive in and explore through a fun, silly little Star Wars themed example.\n\nWe first declare an enumeration which creates some different types of space craft. We then declare a function called get_ship_type whose job is to receive a ship type as a parameter and return a string with a descriptive message. The meat of this function is a match construct.\nMatch has the notion of “arms” which are evaluated one at a time. The first match that is found forms the return value for the function. The other possibilities are ignored until the function is called again with a different ship type. In this case, our function returns a simple static string. For now, ignore the “tick” lifetime modifier on the static str return type, it isn’t important for the topic at hand. I will write about lifetimes in a future article.\nMatches must be exhaustive, all the types we set out in our enum must have a corresponding match arm to check against. The compiler will squawk if you don’t handle all the possibilities.\nIn the main function, we declare variables, one to represent each of our possible ship classifications. Then, one by one, we print out a message, calling our get_ship_type function each time to gather the rest of the message.\nIndividual arms within each part of the match can contain multiple Rust statements, simply enclose the code within curly braces. This is where the power of match comes, sophisticated possibilities and code blocks can form each arm of the match. The results of a particular match arm an also bind to a variable.\nMatch evaluations must be exhaustive. We have to evaluate every possible outcome otherwise a compiler error will occur. What happens if we care about one or two patterns and nothing else? The catch-all pattern, _ , is available. Let’s look at another example:\n\nYou can copy this code into the Rust Playground and it will compile so that you can see the output.\nI haven’t talked about crates yet, but know that we use an external Rust crate which helps generate random numbers. We declare a mutable variable called dice_roll which which contains our random number. Then, we create a random number between 1 and 20 and match on it. If our random number is 20, we print out a success message. If the random number is any other number, then we print out a failure message.\nThe catch-all is useful in situations where we care about one particular result and others can just have a common outcome.\nMatch is useful in error handling code. It is also useful in extracting values out of the Some variant within the Option enum type. It’s a little more elegant that plain old if..else and helps your code be more readable and understandable, as you can avoid complex nested logic. There are some advanced concepts that you can incorporate with the use of match, including the notion of “guards”. I’ll discuss these in a future article.\nThanks for reading! I hope you are enjoying your own Rust journey and are feeling more and more empowered by this amazing language.\nReferences:\nThe Rust Book, Chapter 6.2, The Match Control Flow Construct\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2022/2022-09-30-matchy-matchy/","title":"Matchy Matchy"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/":{"body":"","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/","title":""},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/2023-04-14-resultful-thinking-error-handling-in-rust/":{"body":"The Result enumeration in Rust is the second special enumeration available in the standard library. It is a powerful tool for error handling and enables you to handle errors in an elegant, recoverable fashion. Using the Result enum is a bit of a shift in thinking from other languages.\nThe Result enum has the following signature:\n\nI've yet to write a lot about generics yet, but similar to the Option enum, Result has two generic type parameters. The T represents the type that will be returned in a success case, it's wrapped in a n \"Ok\" variant. The E represents and error type that is reutrned in a failure case, it's wrapped in an \"Err\" variant.\nLet's revisit the contrived example of a program that divides two numbers, as I used in the article on the Option enum:\n\nIn our main function, we declare a numerator variable and a denominator variable. We call the divide function, sending in the numerator and denominator as parameters. The divide function returns a Result, which will either contain our answer, or an error message. The body of the function uses an if statement to establish the return value, be it error or answer. If the denominator passed in as input is zero, this generates a string stating \"Cannot divide by zero\". The main function does a match on the answer value returned by the divide function. We either print out the answer, or print out our error message.\nHandling errors in this way is very elegant. Rather than just throw out an error which could be not very meaningful, we can actually write code that explains very specifically what the issue is. The end result is code which is far more robust.\nWant to know more about the Result type?

I had just begun to develop the slightest notion of what I was doing with the Rust, since finishing Jayson Lennon's Rust course earlier in the year on Zero to Mastery. My learning has always been through a cocktail of blog posts on Medium, random articles on the internet, and bits of Stack Overflow. Hosting my Rust projects was always a struggle for me. I had started Luca Palmieri's \"Zero to Production in Rust\", probably too early, and Chapter 5 of the book on deployment hadn't really stuck. I wanted to crack the deployment bits, because building things and letting them languish on my hard drive was not something I was interested in. For better for worse, I like to build in public. In reality, given the noise on the internet, it's unlikely anyone ever notices, but I enjoy the illusion that I am somehow helping others.\nThere was an article I hit on Medium at one point about getting your Dockerized Rust app, whatever it was, up on fly.io. I followed that article, and began to understand what I had to do. I adapted the procedure for railway.app, which I also discovered and liked a lot. I managed to get a very early \"developer profile\" website together, serve it up with a Rocket backend and get the whole thing served up on railway.app. It was great! I remember feeling like so much had finally clicked...it was terrific feeling.\nUnfortunately, that first site was difficult to maintain, because my skills were still on the weak side, so I abandoned it.\nI still longed for a way to quickly and easily put my creations out into the world.\nEnter Shuttle\nIn those early days of discovering the how's of deployment with Rust, the thing I came away with most was how complex it was, even for my simple little static website. There was a lot of hacking around and trial and error getting that first Dockerfile together such that railway.app would actually accept and build it. Granted, once it was done it was done, but I didn't enjoy the process of getting to a finished DockerFile. I had heard of Shuttle by this point, but when I first discovered this beautiful thing, static file hosting was not yet available. It eventually came along and somewhere early in 2023 I delightedly started to work with static files. I started contributing to the Shuttle documentation for the feature, helping flesh out the instructions and hopefully making the feature easier for others to read, understand, and implement. Shuttle neatly and tidyly takes the pain of Rust deployments away, and I wanted to do my part in showing that to the world in the clearest way I could.\nAxum, with Static Files, on Shuttle\nAxum is a Rust web application framework. It is relatively simple to get up and running with and it's become my go-to lately for doing things on the web with Rust. In February, I restarted Zero to Production in Rust, doing it in Axum instead of Actix. Unfortunately, I've had to halt that project because I've hit a patch that's just out of reach skill wise. I do intend on returning, but am taking a little hiatus for the time being. That hasn't stopped me from wanting to learn more about Axum.\nUnlike other Rust web frameworks like Actix, Axum doesn't have a built in system of middleware. Instead, Axum relies on the Tower ecosystem for creation of support middleware. As far as hosting of static files is concerned, this used to the the territory of the axum-extra crate, which featured a router for single page applications (SPA). The static files example in the Shuttle Docs is based around use of SpaRouter to serve up the files in the static folder that you can provision by annotating your code with #[shuttle_static_folder::StaticFolder] static_folder: PathBuf. SpaRouter was deprecated in version 0.6.0 of axum-extra, in favour of the services available through the tower-http crate.\nI've never liked the notion of relying on bits that are deprecated so I went on a journey, working out exactly how to replace the relative ease of SpaRouter with a similar one-liner. This article by Robert Krahn, was an important find. Robert has kept it up to date, documenting how to get rid of SpaRouter using ServeDir from tower-http::services. The trouble is, I never understood his code. I set out with the intention of either explaining it (for all of you) or coming up with something simpler.\nI've cracked it...at least for a folder of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS files saved into the static folder that Shuttle will provision for you. Let's dig in...\nServeDir with tower-http\nLet's home right in on main.rs:\n\nThis code is pretty much identical to the example you've likely already seen through the Shuttle Docs. The key is use tower_http::services::ServeDir; We bring ServeDir into scope, which gives use a service that serves files from a given directory and all it's sub directories.\nOnce this is in scope, we can use it to build a router with a single endpoint at \"/\", by using .nest_service. We pass in ServeDir::new(static_folder), where static_folder is what Shuttle has provisioned for us. Be sure to put all the files you want to host into that static folder, then, deploy to Shuttle by creating a new project container and deploying the project. All the things work, CSS is called properly when linked from the &lt;head&gt; tag and JavaScript is called when linked from the &lt;script&gt; tag. Navigation works as well within the site.\nThe Shuttle Advantage\nIf you're a Rust afficionado, Shuttle is the way to build and showcase your work to the world. You can build and host your creations without twisting the fiddly dials and knobs of Docker. Leave that to the Shuttle folks. They do the hard work so we as developers don't have to.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/2023-06-05-simple-website-hosting-with-shuttle/","title":"Simple Website Hosting with Shuttle"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/2023-07-31-packages-modules-crates-oh-my/":{"body":"Today, I will give you my take on crates, packages and modules. I've found the organization system for Rust programs to be difficult to master. However, time and practice are solidifying things for me.\nLet's dive in...\nCrates\nA crate is the smallest possible Rust program. The Rust compiler considers this code sample to be a crate:\n\nAn important concept is the crate root. The root is the place the compiler starts from when building out a program. In the tiny example above, whatever we name the file, say \"something.rs\", it is the crate root.\nThere are two types of crates, binary crates and library cates. A binary crate is self contained in that it has an executable file, containing a main function, which can be run on its own without any further action. A library crate contains some piece of functionality meant to be depended on by other crates. It doesn't have a main function and can't run on its own.\nA common way to organize a Rust program is to split it into a binary crate and a library crate. The binary crate contains the executable file, named main.rs or something else you choose. The binary crate then pulls in added functionality from its library crate.\nPackages\nA package is a bundle of one or more crates that combine to provide some piece of functionality. A package contains a cargo.toml file which explains to the Rust compiler how to build the crates contained within the package. Packages can contain one or more binary crates, but only one library crate. There must be at least one crate in the package, be it binary or library.\nThe presence of a Cargo.toml file at the root of the project directory defines the package. By default, Cargo follows the convention that src/main.rs is the root of a binary crate and src/lib.rs is the root of a library crate. The name of the package is taken from the name of the binary or the name of the library, whichever one is present. You can adjust this if you wish and I'll talk about it in the next issue.\nIt's totally up to you as to how to organize your Rust programs. I've found a useful way to organize is to have one binary crate, containing a main.rs file which has initialization and startup logic. The binary crate then calls into the library crate which contains the meat of the program. If your Rust program is small, then it's overkill to organize in this way. However, for larger code bases, such as APIs, organizing like this helps keep the code modular and readable.\nModules\nCrates can be further divided with modules which can live either in one file or separate files. Modules serve as an organizational tool, allowing code to be grouped into units for easier re-use. A second purpose of modules is to control privacy of items. Code in a module is private by default, meaning it's not visible to other code outside that module. Modules can be made public, meaning they are available to be made into dependencies within the program as a whole. You can put modules all into one file, but this can quickly become difficult to navigate. It's usually preferable to setup a structure in which modules are organized into separate files.\nPaths\nThe Rust compiler needs to know where things are. A path can be used in a similar fashion to navigating file system on Windows, Linux, or macOS. Paths can take a couple of forms:\n\nabsolute: the full path starting from the crate root (begins with the crate name for an external crate and begins with the literal crate for code from the current crate)\nrelative: starts from the current module and uses the keywords self, super or an identifier in the current module (super, for example, will reference the next level up)\n\nUse Keyword\nThe use keyword brings a module into scope, allowing its contents to be accessible to other parts of a Rust program.\nNamespace Operator\nThe namespace operator in Rust is a double colon, :: The namespace operator is used in conjunction with the use keyword.\nPutting it all together...\nWith all these concepts in mind, how do we put it all together? Stay tuned...in a future post I'll show you how to start using these concepts to make your Rust programs more understandable.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/2023-07-31-packages-modules-crates-oh-my/","title":"Packages, Modules, and Crates..Oh My!"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/2023-10-11-demystifying-middleware-in-actix-web/":{"body":"Introduction\nEarlier this year, I worked through Zero to Production in Rust by Luca Palmieri using the Axum web framework. This a) forced me to learn that framework and b) force me to think when overcoming the differences.\nAs I moved through the book, I felt that Actix Web seemed the superior choice for someone of my skill level, as it had more hand holding. Axum, for the most part, leaves you to your own devices, which is great if you know what you're doing, but not so great if you're really just a beginner.\nIn late September I decided to return to Actix Web and make an API to allow me to track my daily music listening habits. I'm not going into the details of that project in this post, instead I'm going to focus on one corner that I found challenging, middleware. Per usual for me, I need to see a purpose or example, which helps me attach meaning to the abstract and enables me to understand how to use a particular language feature. Middleware in Actix Web is not well explained for newcomers. I find the docs do a decent job of explaining the high level theory, but like with the majority of Rust documentation, they lack context and simple examples.\nA Primer on Traits\nActix Web's middleware system is based on the Service and Transform traits. We can't talk about these until we brush up a little on traits in Rust. Per the Rust Book:\n\nA trait defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that generic type can be any type that has a certain behavior.\n\nTraits are a means of providing your own types with functionality, without having to write all that functionality from scratch yourself. They are like a contract that provide a blueprint to implement functionality.\nI'm not going to go super in depth beyond this, I've linked in the references below to the in-depth chapters in The Rust Book.\nWhat is Middleware?\nThe term \"middleware\" identifies a type of software that sits in the middle between one thing and the next. It can be thought of as a bridge, facilitating communications between parts of a software system. Another good analogy is plumbing. Middleware connects one or more applications so that data came move through them like water through a pipe network.\nWhy use Middleware?\nThe main advantage of middleware is it reduces complexity. In the context of a server API, middleware can combine functionality into one block, rather than each endpoint implementing its own version of that functionality. The result is reduced complexity and fewer places to introduce bugs. We'll see this in action further on in the example I've created.\nAuthentication is an area where middleware is often used. Authentication services can be implemented as middleware and \"gatekeep\" the rest of the application such that the middleware intercepts all incoming requests before passing properly authenticated users to the lands beyond. Handling authentication via middleware saves each endpoint from having to do it. The middleware authenticates the user and either lets them pass on to the endpoint they wanted, or rejects the attempt.\nHow to use Middleware in Actix Web\nMiddleware in Actix Web centers around implementing the Service and Transform traits. Both these traits must be implemented on a type. The Transform trait initializes the middleware and acts like a factory. The factory builds the particular service defined by the Service trait. One difficulty I had is separating boiler plate code from the 'real' code that you write to implement functionality. Let's take a look at the bare minimum boiler plate to get off the ground. We'll make a simple middleware to process an API key.\n\nWhew! I don't know about you but I'm kind of exhausted. That's a lot of code! The trait implementations give us a lot to think about and follow. This middleware will essentially do nothing. All the hard work above just sets it up so that you can wrap your endpoints with it. As it stands above, the boiler plate will pass an unmodified request straight on to the endpoint, whatever that may be.\nAlright, let's break all this down:\nDependencies\n\n\nwe need tools from actix_web and the actix_web::dev module\n\nfoward_ready is a macro which, as the docs say, is an implementation of the function poll_ready which returns Ready which is a type of future that is immediately ready with a value\nService\n\na trait, for implementing an asynchronous operation from a Request to a Response\n\n\nServiceRequest\n\na service level request wrapper\n\n\nServiceResponse\n\na service level response wrapper\nin the Transform trait there is a type EitherBody. EitherBody is an enum with two variants, Left and Right. Each variant can contain a BoxBody type, which is a boxed message body with boxed errors\n\n\nTransform\n\ndefines the interface of a service factory and is what builds our middleware service\n\n\n\n\n\nwe need the Error struct from actix_web\n\n\nthere are a few things from the standard library that are necessary, in order to enable working with futures\n\nready\n\na function which immediately returns a future with a value\n\n\nReady\n\na struct which represents our future and it's associated value, it's the output of the ready function\n\n\n\n\n\nwe'll also pull in LocalBoxFuture from the futures_util crate\n\nLocalBoxFuture is a \"An owned dynamically typed Future for use in cases where you can’t statically type your result or need to add some indirection\"\n\nit doesn't have the Send requirement, meaning it can't be transferred across thread boundaries\n\n\n\n\n\nStructs\nMiddleware is always implemented for a type. We need two structs:\n\nApiKey\n\nacts a hook to trigger the middleware\n\n\nApiKeyMiddleware\n\nthe actual middleware service that is built, called, and executed\n\n\n\nTransform trait\nWhen you push aside all the trait bounds and type definitions, the core of the transform trait is the new_transform function. This function takes a &amp;self reference and a service as parameters, and returns a future. You can think of this function as a factory that creates your middleware service. It's necessary for each middleware service that you make.\nService trait\nSimilar to Transform, there are a lot of trait bounds and type definitions to wade through. Again, the core of the Service trait is the call function. This is where the meat goes. It takes a reference to self and an incoming request as parameters, and returns a future. The Future type definition constrains the call function to return a future or an error.\nClear as mud? I thought so. Let's make the boiler plate do something now.\nMeat of the Matter\nThis middleware will check the validity of an incoming API key. This example was created to run over on Shuttle and I won't get into the details of that, except to say the valid API key is stored in a secrets file which is read into and saved in the application state, using web::Data. This approach is overly simplistic and meant mainly for my learning purposes, so that there is something simple where I (and hopefully you) can visualize the flow. In real life you're not going to handle an API key in this fashion.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\nwe read the incoming API key from the \"x-api-key\" key/value pair that comes in with a request header, the content gets converted into a string slice\nwe read in the valid API key from application state, it gets cloned to make the compiler happy...at least that's what I had to do, I'm sure someone more experience would do it in a better way\nwe compare the API keys, if they don't match the request is refused and an error message is returned\nassuming the API key checks out, we pass the request through to it's appropriate endpoint.\n\nIn the API key validation if block, we split the request into it a request and payload, by destructuring into a tuple. Then, we construct the \"unauthorized\" error response we want to give, mapping it into the right variant of our ServiceResponse type, which is an EitherBody type because of our trait definition. The right variant of EitherBody typically holds error responses.\nIf the API key is valid, then we pass through the request, using the left variant of our ServiceResponse type, which represents the response from the middleware, which in this case is the unmodified request.\nOk, so, we finally have some middleware. how do we use it?\n\nThis is the hello world example from the Actix Web docs. I've modified to show where our middleware gets invoked as the app spins up. It's called by the .wrap() function the precedes the call to the greet endpoint handler. That's it! I haven't done it in the snip above, but you would need to bring your ApiKey type into scope with a use statement, assuming it lives in a separate module file. As a point of good practice, and given how long middleware might be, it's best to split it up into separate module files.\nIf you have multiple middleware pieces, you write each one separately and wrap it with a struct in the same fashion. Remember that middleware is executed in the opposite order to registration.\nConclusion\nMade it! I hope you enjoyed this short journey through Actix Web middleware. This is not exhaustive, and I'm sure there are a million nuances I've missed. I hope I've captured for you the flow of what you need to write your own. Remember, the boiler plate above can be added to your project and it will just sit and be ready for expansion. Once it's done, it's done and you just need to add your logic to the call function within the Service trait implementation.\nMy purpose here was to understand full blow middleware, so that's been the focus of this piece. I would be mistaken to not say that there is a simpler way to do middleware, if it's literally something dead simple. It's experimental right now, but will likely graduate sometime soon. Simpler Actix Web Middleware\nI invite you to dig deeper in the articles below, especially Luca's. He's developing the Pavex web framework and in doing that, having to figure out his own take a middleware system. It's a terrific read.\nNow, venture forth and make some middleware!

A vector is similar to an array type, but with the critical difference that a vector can grow and shrink in size. A vector is capable of storing a list of items in a single data structure. All the individual values in a vector are stored next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store data of the same type.\nI called this article \"The Mighty Vector\" because vectors are an extremely versatile and useful way of storing data. I think you'll use them quite a bit in your own Rust adventures.\nCreation\nVec::new() Function\nA fresh, empty vector can be created like so:\n\nSince we haven't initialized this coordinates vector with values, we have to tell the compiler what we want, because otherwise it won't know. The vector type provided by the Rust standard library is implemented using generics and can hold any type. In this case we've said that our coordinates vector is going to contain i32 elements.\nvec! Macro\nMore often than not, we want to initialize a vector with some values. Rust gives us a macro, the vec! macro, which creates a vector with whatever values we choose:\n\nThe initial values allow the compiler to infer what we want, so we don't have to use a type annotation like in the first example.\nModifying a Vector\nHopefully you recall that all variables in Rust, when declared, are immutable, they can't be changed. If we know we need to change the values in our vector, we need to use the mut keyword:\n\nThen, we can add values to this vector by using the push method:\n\nLet's make a complete program to see what we get:\n\nHere we initialize our vector with some default i32 values, then we push 3 more values into the vector. Finally, we use a for loop to print out the values to the console. Note that we don't need any type annotations because the Rust compiler can infer from the information we've provided.\n\nReading the Elements in a Vector\nSo, we can add elements to our vector, how do we read the elements back? Rust gives us a couple of ways, depending on what we want our program to do.\nPanic Attack\nThe first way of reading an element is by simple indexing.\n\nIn one of the greatest quirks of computer science, which to this day trips just about everyone up at one time or another, vectors are indexed starting at zero. In the previous example, the indices of our coordinates vector are 0, 1, 2. To get the third element, let's call it the 'z' coordinate, we use &amp; and [] along with the index 2, to give us a reference to the element 23.\nThis is all fine and happy if the element at the index we request exists. What if it doesn't? If it doesn't, the program panics and immediately terminates. We might want that behaviour, so it is a legitmate option.\nMore Elegant Way\nThere is another more elegant way to handle the possibility of a vector element not existing:\n\nThe .get() method, when passed an index that is outside of the vector's range, leverages the Option type and returns a None value without the panic. You can then use the match statement to gracefully handle the possibilities. This approach results in more user friendliness than a panic and crash, because you can craft error messages to explain what happened.\nEnums to Store Multiple Types\nRemember earlier I said that vectors can only hold data of the same type? Well, I lied a teeny tiny bit. We can leverage Rust's enum type to get around this limitation. There are times when we may want to have a list of items that have different types.\n\nThis is not the greatest example, because the variations represented by the enum SportsTeam are not that dramatically different. However, it illustrates that we can create a vector to hold some information about our sports team and because the underlying type of each vector element is an enum, this satisfies the need that the elements all be of the same type.\nA vector is stored on the heap. The Rust compiler must know exactly how much memory space to allocate at compile time. A match expression needs to be used which aids the compiler in ensuring that every possible variation is handled. If the data in your program is such that you can't know the exhaustive set of types at runtime that a vector will contain, then this enum technique won't work. The solution is to use a trait object, which I'll cover in a future article.\nConclusion\nThis article has been my take on vectors. I've gone over the basics, but be sure to check out the Rust Standard Library documentation for the std::vec module, as there are more things you can do with this powerful and flexible data type.\nThanks for reading!\nReferences\nRust Standard Library, Module std::vec\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 8.1 Storing List of Values with Vectors\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2023/2023-11-07-the-mighty-vector/","title":"The Mighty Vector"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/":{"body":"","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/","title":""},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-07-14-jeff-mitchell-dev-re-reloaded/":{"body":"The Road So Far...\nIt's said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\nIt embarrasses me to think on how many times I've tried to start a blog.\nWordpress, Zola, Medium, roll-your-own, micro-blogging with Twitter (now X), probably some tools I've forgotten...I've tried and failed so many times.\nIt's really shameful, the amount of time spent...wasted really.\nThe core problem, in all the efforts so far, is a focus on the \"platform\", rather than the \"writing\".

The difficulty stems from the different ways strings are handled by the language. This article reflects the two core types of strings and my understanding of them. It will evolve over time. Be aware, this does not offer the be-all-end-all explanation of strings. The main purpose here is to provide a jumping off point for me, and you, to dive deeper as needed. To often, I avoid writing because I feel I can't do a topic justice.\nThis is just an excuse.\nLet's go.\nWhat the Heck is UTF-8?\nBefore we can examine the string collection type in Rust. We need to understand what is UTF-8, which stands for Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits. I'm not going to attempt to write about it, it's well explained here: What is UTF-8 Encoding? A Guide for Non-Programmers\nIn a nutshell, UTF-8 is an encoding method which covers every character in any human language, yes emojis included.\nRust encodes strings into UTF-8 by default.\nFlavours of Strings\nThe internet will yell at me if I don't point out the fact that there are many string types in Rust, I'm not going to list them all. However, in your day to day Rusting, I maintain there are really two you're going to care about:\n\nthe String type\nthe &amp;str type\n\nLet's get into 'em.\nStrings are Magical Paper\nIn preparing this article, I asked to ChatGPT to explain the String type to me like I was five. Here's what it came up with, which I thought was pretty good:\n\nLet's imagine that a String in Rust is like a magical piece of paper that can change its size to hold different words or sentences.\nMagic Paper: The String is like a piece of paper that you can write on. If you write \"Hello,\" it fits perfectly. If you want to write \"Hello, world!\" instead, the paper can grow to fit the new words.\nEasy to Change: You can add more words to your magical paper. If you have \"Hello\" and you want to add \" world,\" you can just stick it on, and the paper will get bigger to fit the new words.\nSpecial Marker: This paper has a special marker called the end marker. It always knows where the end of your writing is, so it knows exactly how long your sentence is.\nStart Small, Grow Big: You don't need to know how big your sentence will be at the beginning. You can start with a tiny piece of paper and let it grow as you add more words.\nSuper Flexible: You can do all sorts of things with this magical paper. You can take words away, change them, or even find out how many letters there are.\nIn Rust, the String type works just like this magical paper. It's a flexible, growable piece of text that you can change however you want. It's different from a &amp;str (a string slice) which is more like a regular piece of paper that can't change size.\n\nI thought this was actually pretty good.\nA String is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encode type. Behind any String is a Vec&lt;T&gt; where the type is bytes, it is a collection of bytes organized into a vector.\nThere are several ways to crate a String type, which can be confusing, but they have their time and place.\n\nYou can create an empty string: let mut s = String::new();\nThe to_string() method is available on an type that implements the Display trait: let s = \"I'm a string\".to_string();\nWe can use String::from() to create a String from a string literal: let s = String::from(\"I'm a string too!);\n\nThe last two a functionally equivalent, your choice comes down to style and preference.\nA View to a String\nThat was String, what is a string slice? Again, let's ask ChatGPT:\n\nLet's imagine that a string slice in Rust is like a piece of paper with words on it that you can look at but not change.\nSnapshot Paper: A string slice, written as &amp;str, is like taking a picture of a part of your magical paper. This picture shows the words exactly as they are, but you can't add or remove words from the picture.\nJust Looking: If you have a book and you want to show someone just one sentence from a page, you can take a picture of that sentence. They can read the sentence in the picture, but they can't change any of the words.\nPoint to Words: When you have a string slice, you're just pointing to some words that are already written down somewhere else. You're not making a new copy of the words; you're just saying, \"Look here!\"\nSmall Window: You can take a string slice of any part of the text. If your magical paper says \"Hello, world!\" you can take a slice that just shows \"Hello\" or \"world\" or even \"lo, wo\".\nNo Changing Allowed: The important thing is that with a string slice, you're not allowed to change the words. It's like looking through a window at something outside. You can see it, but you can't reach through the window to change it.\nIn Rust, a string slice (&amp;str) is a way to look at a piece of text without changing it. It’s like pointing at part of a String or another piece of text and saying, \"I want to see this part,\" but not being able to change what you see.\n\nA &amp;str is a pointer into memory which holds a string slice.\nUse Cases - When to Choose String over &amp;str\nThe String type is most useful when you don't want to worry about ownership and lifetimes. However, be aware that you're allocating memory every time you create a new String variable. This may incur a performance penalty that's unacceptable. Also, the String type doesn't implement the Copy trait, so using it as a field in a struct may cause issues and cloning is your best option...which again, may incur a performance hit that might or might not be ok.\nSince a &amp;str is a view to a String, you can't change it, you can only view it. The &amp;str type is good for function parameters, where many times you're just passing information in and don't need to worry about ownership of the data being passed.\nConclusion\nThat was your brief introduction to strings in Rust! This is a very, very watered down version, there is much more to know. Please check out the full scoop in the Rust Book.\nReferences\n\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 4.3: The Slice Type\nThe Rust Programming Language, Chapter 8.2: Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with String\nRust By Example: Strings\n\nBlog Articles\n\nHow Strings Work in Rust\n\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-07-30-string-theory/","title":"String Theory"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-07-31-rust-pdf-extractor-program-of-the-week/":{"body":"It's the last day of July 2024, just where is the time going?

It’s very light and is built on top of the hyper HTTP library. Hyper reached a major milestone in November 2023, with it’s version 1.0 release. Axum was bumped to version 0.7 shortly after. The Tokio team wrote a great blog post explaining the major changes.\nAlright, let’s get into some code…\n\nDependencies\nFirst, we bring into scope several things from the axum crate itself:\n\nthe Html type and IntoResponse trait, both from the response module\nthe get method from the routing module, used to handle get requests\nthe Router type, used to compose handlers and services\nthe SocketAddr type from the standard library\nthe TcpListener type from the Tokio crate\n\nAxum relies on the Tokio crate for asyncronous operations, so be sure Tokio is added as a dependency in the Cargo.toml configuration file.\nLet’s look at the main function first, then we’ll talk about the single handler function as part of that.\nMain Function\nThe general algorithm of our main function is:\n\ncreate an instance of our app; has one route at “/”, which accepts a get request and calls our hello_from_axum handler function\n\nthe hello_from_axum function takes no parameters, it simply returns some HTML created by reading in an index.html file using the include_str! macro\nthe impl IntoResponse return type indicates that we leverage the fact that Axum knows how to return an Html message without us writing any extra code, the IntoResponse trait is already implemented for the Html type\n\n\ncreate an address\ncreate a port\nuse the address and port to create a socket\ncreate a listener, using the socket we just created, to listen for requests; there is some basic error handling here with a match statement, we panic if the attempt to get an address fails\nstart up the server, using the axum::serve method, passing in the listener and app variables\n\nError handling is purposely left fairly basic. It’s generally not a good practice to panic and crash the program, but in this instance it makes sense. The application can’t run without an address to listen on or a listener to receive requests, so if these things fail there isn’t a lot of point in doing anything else.\nThat’s it!\nIf you typed everything in correctly, you can start up the basic server by typing:\n\ninto your console. The server should start up and be listening on port 3000. If something happens error wise, you’ll see error messages returned at the console.\nHead over to your web browser and type:\n\nYou should be greeted with:\n\nPretty cool hey?\nI know, not really. It’s pretty basic and not very interesting. Axum is terrific in its simplicity, but at the same time has much power and a great ecosystem. It really is garnering the mindshare of the Rust community and many projects appear to be standardizing around it. I bounced around between things for a long time, but have recently decided to just learn Axum properly.\nThere are a few warts on this simple server, chief of which is it doesn’t shut down very gracefully.

I found her fresh and inspiring. Her clean and clear explanation style helped me gain insight into important concepts.\nThis article today is inspired by some of her work. I'm going to write a little about git.\nGit is a version control system, mostly aimed at software development, but you can use it for anything where you want to track changes and undo any foot wounds inflicted on yourself. Git was built by Linus Torvalds in 2005. You can read a short history of it here. I'm not going to cover GitHub in this article. Git is the system for version control, whereas GitHub is an online hosted repository for hosting and sharing code \"pushed\" to it from a local project on your computer.\nAlright, let's git into it and give you the bare bones...haha, see what I did there? I know...terrible...\nWhat is Git?\nAs I said above, Git is a version control system. Teams benefit most from using it. A group can collaborate on a code base, and by building on \"branches\", individuals can work together without stepping on each others toes. Git does the heavy lifting of tracking changes and history of coding projects. While teams benefit most, anyone can add it to their coding workflow.\nInstalling\nI'll refer you to Tania's article on Git, linked in the references.\nInitial Steps\nLet's start a Rust program, initially with no support from Git, then we'll add it. In fairness, the cargo build tool configures a project for you automatically with git support, but frequently I like to ignore that and git going (yes, I need to stop) after the initial setup is complete. Do this wherever you want to work on your code:\n\nA new Rust project that contains a skeleton \"Hello World\" executable program will be created for you. The --vcs none flag tells Cargo not to do any git setup.\nInitialization\nChange into the directory of the project you just created, cd project-with-git and type: git init. This will initialize a repository \"repo\" for you and create a .git directory which holds the configuration and instructions for how the git will manage the repo.\nWhat to Ignore\nNext, type: touch .gitignore. Open the project in your editor of choice, for me that's VS Code, and you should see the freshly created .gitignore along with the other project files. Git will track everything in your project if you let it. That's great mostly, but you don't need to track anything in the /target directory, which contains build artifacts and other internals generated by the Rust compiler. Edit your .gitignore to look like:\n\nThe syntax of a .gitignore is pretty straightforward:\n\nanything preceded by # is a comment\nexclude directories by doing &lt;/directory_name&gt;\nyou can use wildcards, i.e. Shuttle*.toml\n\nAdding Files to Track\nTo add the files you do want to track, type: git add . This will add everything not excluded by .gitignore into git's list of what to officially keep track of.\nCommitting\nOnce you've added the files, changes aren't tracked until you actually \"commit\" them. To do that type: git commit -m \"Initial commit\" This will create your first commit into the history with the message \"Initial Commit\". Well done! You've offically begun tracking the history of this project. You're project lives locally on your computer at this point, it's not connected to the internet and you are the only one who can work on it.\nBranching\nAfter the above, youi'll be on the \"main\" branch of your project. Let's say you've worked awhile, but change your mind and want to explore another direction, without losing what you just started. You can make a branch.\nTo create a branch, type: git branch &lt;new-branch-name&gt;. This will create a branch in which you can work on a new feature, a bug fix, or just explore a different direction, but not lose your original work. Branches have to be \"checked out\" when you make them, by doing: git checkout &lt;new-branch-name&gt;.\nFollow the sames steps as above to commit your branch into the tracking sytem. You can go back to main by: git checkout main. This will switch you back to your main branch. If you look, you'll see that any changes you just made are not in this main branch.\nMerging\nLet's say you end up liking the approach you took in the fresh branch you just created. When it comes time to unite the two branches do this: git merge &lt;new-branch-name&gt; this will \"merge\" the new code into the old and unite it under the main branch. You can then push out to production and the new feature or bug fix will be incorporated.\nPretty nifty hey?!\nConclusion\nThere's really no reason not to use git. It makes your software development life much easier. If you make a mistake or what to start over, by leveraging the branching system you can simply \"switch back\" to an earlier point in time. It's really a no-brainer.\nIn this short piece I've given you the basics to get started. From here, you can practice on your own and explore the links I've provided below to learn more. Remember, cargo initializes a git repo for you, you don't need to go through the steps above every time.\nReferences\n\n\nGit\n\n\nGetting Started with Git for Version Control\n\n\nGit Notes Getting Started\n\n\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-23-git-bare-bones/","title":"Git - The Bare Bones"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-24-slow-down-to-speed-up/":{"body":"I'm in a reflective mood this evening.\nI feel a bit triggered by my inabilty to build my own Redis on codecraters.io.

When you visit an internet location, a server answers and gives you back a series of files which your browser takes and renders into something meaningful.\nThis is overly simplistic, but there's a lot to unpack at each step and having a high level view of what's going on can help.\nEvery web site, every last one, is built on this foundation of technologies:\n\nHTML\nCSS\nJavaScript\n\nThe methods and techniques may vary, but at the end of the day that's what the browser needs to render information to you as the viewer.\nA web server gives back an HTML file (usually called index.html) which has links to styles (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript). When a browser makes requests for these resources, it does that via links available in the HTML file.\nStructure (Hyper-Text Markup Language, HTML)\nEvery web site needs bones and a skeleton. It's HTML's job to express how a web site, including its content and structure, is to be represented. This is the first thing the browser loads. The browser constructs a model in memory, called the Document Object Model (DOM). I always feel slightly dirty when I say DOM...I digress...\nStyles (Cascading Style Sheets, CSS)\nIt's the job of CSS to express what a web site looks like. CSS rules allow you to selectively target HTML elements and apply a style to them. This is the second thing loaded by the browser. The browser also constructs a CSS Object Model (CSSOM) which can be targeted and manipulated dynamically with JavaScript. The style and structure are ultimately combined into a \"render tree\" which the browser uses to \"paint\" the final web site into view.\nFunctionality (JavaScript)\nA web site can exist with only HTML and CSS, technically you don't need anything else. However, it's static and relatively boring. You can do a lot with these technologies now, more than 10 years ago, and depending on what you're doing minimal interactivity might be fine. Generally speaking though, you're going to need some JavaScript. It enables interactivity, the ability to manipulate state, and the ability to change the page content, structure, and style dynamically. JavaScript is the very last thing the browser loads.\nClosing\nThis has been a very basic overview of the fundamental web technologies and how individual web sites work. I'll explore each one further and write about them over the next while.

I found Zero to Mastery and their Rust course. With a great head of steam, as I did the course, I also started blogging my way through the Rust Book. This head of steam continued nicely through the more basic aspects of the language, but as I entered the deeper waters, I faltered.\nOne of the areas I faltered in was the Hashmap collection type. I found it difficult to think up something specific to write about, but didn't want to just rehash/regurgitate the chapter content from the Rust book. So, I asked ChatGPT, which is great for offering suggestions, and it gave me a few clues. Oddly enough, this interaction also gave me a clue in general for a structure for future posts on this blog.\nI can come up with a problem, then write about how to solve it in a structured way. In this instance, how can we use hashmaps as part of the solution to a particular problem?\nLet's dive in!\nWhat is a HashMap?\nA HashMap is a data type which stores mappings of keys to values. A hashing function is used to determine placement of these keys and values in memory. The advantage of a HashMap is that the key can be of any type. Rust considers HashMaps as a \"collection\" so you'll see it referred to as a collection type. It's not the most used data structure, so you have to bring it into scope in your programs.\nHashMaps are stored in heap memory. Their keys must be all of the same type and their values must be all of the same type.\nThe Problem\nI'd like a simple way of remembering snippets of text with a keyword attached to each for searching. I'd like some tool that will be a portable memory aid. It should let me create, retrieve, update and delete items of knowledge. I'd like it to have storage so that what I enter is not lost. Finally, I want to be able to take this program with me whereever I go.\nThe Solution\nAdmittedly, this is a little contrived, and there are probably much, much better ways to solve this problem, but we're going to leverage HashMaps and create a little CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) tool. It's not going to be a command line interface (CLI) tool, but will still be terminal based with a menu driven user inteface. We'll keep it modular, using functions rather than one giant blob in the main function. We'll also try to pull in many of the basic Rust data types, such as enums, and control flow mechanisms, like loop. Lastly, we're going to confine ourselves to what's available in the Rust standard library, no community crates.\nAlgorithm (Design)\nData Types - Snippet\nI've learned that in Rust, types are central (duh, I know). We begin by thinking about our data and the constrait that it needs to be represented by a HashMap. I want to store text snippetssuch as web links. Our key could be just a word, like \"Tera\" for entries related to the Tera template engine. The key can just be a string. The associated value is words and characters, representing our code snippet. It could also be stored as a string. We're going to wrap our Snippet HashMap in a struct, which will let us implement the Default trait for it, making it easy to initialize or even outright reset our data. Our Snippet type will look like this:\n\nWe could do this without the struct, but I'm trying to practice some concepts here so bear with me. It's always a good idea to derive the Debug trait on any struct, so we do it for good measure.\nWe can then implement the Default trait, which will initialize and return and empty Snippet HashMap for us;\n\nData Types - Menu Items\nWe need something to represent the main menu of our program, which will need to present 5 choices: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete, Exit. The natural choice here is an enum. It will look like this:\n\nMethods on the Snippet Type\nOnce our data type is set, we can think in terms of methods on the data. What we will need will look like this:\n\nGeneral Program Structure\nWe'll need to declare our data types, their methods, as well as a couple of helper functions. We'll need functions which display the menu, get input from the user, and read/write to our storage medium, which will just be a file.\nThe program will run in a loop, presenting menu choices to the user for further action. The loop will be endless until the user chooses the \"Exit\" menu option, at which time the program will terminate.\nAfter a couple of weeks of messing about, and yes, drifting between other things, here's what I came up with:\nFinal Code\nIn future I probably won't spit out the entire code like this, but for today I will. Here's the final result:\n\nSome Key Aspects\nThere are a couple of key things to call out:\n\nI have an odd obsession with not using the `println!' macro. As of this program, I'm kind of favouring to not do things with macros.\nI've tried to get rid of all pesky .unwraps(), errors should generally be handled decently\nI haven't made a custom error type or pulled in anyhow or color_eyre because, generally, failures can be handled by returning a std::io::Result&lt;()&gt;\n\nI've used one .except(), in the input_to_snippet function, which I feel is reasonable because if you can't read in the saved data (the String::from_utf8 conversion could fail for characters that are not UTF-8) there's not much point in continuing. You may disagree.\n\n\n\nAreas for Further Work\nThis \"tool\" isn't complete. I haven't implemented the ability to save yet. I thought I'd leave you the reader to tackle that. How would you modify my code to append data back to the file? In the future I'll write about my solution.\nClosing\nThanks for reading. I hope the HashMap collection type is a little less mysterious for you. It's much less mysterious for me after going through this exercise.\nCode on GitHub\nYou can find a repo to support for this article here:\nmemoria-rs\nReferences\nThe Rust Programming Language: Chapter 8.3\nResources\nRust Standard Library: HashMap Collection\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-26-the-mystery-of-the-hashmap/","title":"The Mystery of the Hashmap"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-27-good-html-a-solid-foundation/":{"body":"I get down on myself, a lot.

Some aspects of Yew, such as handling form input, and enabling interactivity, have troubled me and I was unable to make progress.\nUntil last week...\nA long time ago, when Google searching about Yew and how to do things, I discovered The Workfall Blog. In particular, this article about form handling kind of filled in some missing pieces I couldn't glean from the Yew documentation.\nOver the past few days, I practiced in my own intranet site project and am pleased to say that I finally understand how to handle form input.

The sophistication of error handling is one of the language's biggest advantages. It's easy to gracefully handle whatever errors may arise. It can also be a source of frustration, because the compiler lets you get away with nearly nothing, expecting all paths, including error paths, to be handled. Compared to a dynamically typed language, this can feel a bit straight jacket-ish. The benefit is fewer surprises when things go wrong. By thinking just that little bit harder up front, and leveraging the tools Rust provides, the output is something you'll have to worry about less.\nLet's take a look more deeply.\nTo Recover or Not to Recover...That is the Question\nIt's a fact of life that operations can fail. When things go wrong, what can we do? Errors come in two flavours when programming in Rust, unrecoverable and recoverable.\nUnrecoverable Errors\nSometimes, things go so wrong that there's just nothing that can be done. In these instances, we halt execution of our program and provide some final message or output that will allow you the programmer to (hopefully) figure out what went wrong. The in built way of doing this in Rust is to use the panic! macro, which halts execution, cleans up the stack and dumps you out to the terminal with a terse error message.\nRust gives us the ability to not deal with errors at all, via the .unwrap() method. If we know an operation or function will fail but we don't care, we can just choose to throw the error away. If there is no happy path, the program will simply error out with a panic and terminate. There are times when it's appropriate to use unwrap(), mainly in cases where a) we know the failure path is not a problem or unlikely to occur or b) as a starting point. It can frequently be a stepping stone to unwrap on something, then later handling the error more gracefully.\nA variation on .unwrap() is .expect() which panics, but allows you to attach context which is output when the panic happens.\nAll of the above have one thing in common, program execution is over when they happen.\nRecoverable Errors\nThere are many instances where, yes, something can go wrong, but whatever it was could be recovered from such that we pick ourselves up, dust off, and carry on. We can communicate some bit of information to the user such that they can fix a typo in their input or make an alternate choice that lets the program continue.\nFortunately, Rust provides a nice way for us to, once again, leverage the type system and recover from errors if we choose.\nGrace, Too...The Result&lt;T, E&gt; Type\nI wrote about the Result but let's have another go with a small program to read text from a file and print it back out. Here's the code:\n\nThe ? Operator\nThe above is a little verbose. Let's do better:\n\nHere we use the Rust ? operator, which is some syntactic sugar which does the equivalent of the code in the match {} blocks shown above. This special operator:\n\nevaluates the Result&lt;T, E&gt; type that comes back from the IO related operations.\nif it's the error path, we do an early return and print the error.\nif it's the Happy Path, execution continues as we expect, the file is read into the variable input_file and later the data contained within the file, is output.\n\nUse of the ? operator makes your Rust programs a whole lot more concise. In your mind, when you see it, you can think \"possible failure here, we either succeed and carry on, or we error out\".\nWhen the ? is used in a function body, the function signature must include returning a Result type. In this instance we say we are \"propagating\" the error back to the caller, which could potentially be the main function. It will be up to the main function to handle the returned result type in some final, possibly different, way.\nWhen the Result type is used, program termination is more under the programmers control. The type can be used to set pathways that allow recovery and continued program operation. The example program above does not handle errors any more gracefully per se, but using the Result type, together with embelished error information (the actual error is included with the overall message) the programmer gains more control over the messaging.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe Rust Book is overly wordy on the matter of error handling. Here I've attempted to break it down in the way I've started to understand and use it. It can be one of the more difficult language aspects to grasp, but once you've got it, it's hard to go without it.\nReferences\n\nThe Rust Programming Language: Error Handling\nThe simplest guide to error handling in Rust\n\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-14-error-handling/","title":"Saving the Day: Error Handling"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-15-serving-the-web-with-rocket/":{"body":"Introduction\nI want to challenge the notion that it's difficult to do things with Rust. Yes, you have to learn the language, and yes, the learning curve is steep. However, I maintain that you don't have to be all the way up the learning curve to be productive.\nThanks to \"batteries included\" web frameworks like Rocket it's quick to get started. In 30 minutes, at worst an hour, you can have a minimal web server together which let's you do server side rendering with templates. The served templates can be styled with CSS and livened with JavaScript, all with plain 'ol vanilla web tech.\nEven better, you can host on Shuttle's Rust native development platform, which takes the heavy lifting away so you can focus on what you actually want to make.\nLet's get this Rocket to the Vehicle Assembly Building.\nGetting Started\nHead to where ever you save your coding projects on our own computer. First thing to do is install Shuttle. You can get the latest build for your operating system by following the instructions on the Shuttle website.\nAt a command prompt, type:\n\nFollow the prompts by entering a project name, choosing the location, and picking a starting framework. Those steps will look like this:\n\nI'm using the new beta Shuttle platform, but the steps are basically the same regardless. This will give you some basic boilerplate on which to build further.\nAdding a Health Check Route\nOpen your favourite code editor, and modify the code in main.rs to look like this:\n\nThis code gives you a minimum Rocket server with one route at /api/health. This route has a handler function which responds with a 200 OK and empty body. This is a \"health check\" route that you can use in a basic way to poll if your server is running.\nOne aside to point out here, we have the routes created with a separate function called create() which takes no arguments and returns a Rocket instance configured with routes. We then call this create() function from our main() function. Separation like this facilitates testing, which I'll get into in the future.\nServing Static Files\nA web server needs to make assets available when routes are hit. With Rocket, an entire website can be served from the / index route by modifying our main.rs like so:\n\nI've gone ahead and added templating for Tera as well. You'll need to do cargo add tera to add the dependency to your Cargo.toml configuration. We pull in Rocket's fs module and leverage the FileServer method, passing it a relative path to the folder called 'static' which will live in the root of your project and serve as home to static assets. While you're at it, at the same level, create a folder called 'templates'. When done, your project directory tree should look like:\n\nTera Templating\nI sort of folded a couple of steps into one above, so let's talk about the templating step a little more. Rocket has super easy support for the Tera templating engine, which is the one I've been focusing on lately. We add support for templating in general by pulling in rocket_dyn_templates as a dependency, specifically the context! macro and Template responder. In our create() function, we have to add a so-called \"fairing\", which automatically registers all available templates saved in the /templates folder in the project root.\nWe add a route and handler function which serves back the equivalent of index.html. We pass a message variable, via the context! macro with the text \"Hello, World!\" which will be rendered into the template at the location of our choice.\nFinishing Touches\nThere are a couple of last things to do, we need to actually have some templates. Create base.tera.html and index.tera.html in the templates folder, and give them the following content:\nbase.tera.html:\n\nindex.tera.html:\n\nThe Moment of Truth\nWith all these pieces in place:\n\nOnce the Rocket web server launches, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 and you should see served up in your browser:\n\nEasy peasy!\nFrom here, you can add more resources, routes, logic, whatever you need. Assets are served up from the assets folder and you can apply CSS styles and JavaScript as you traditionally would in a vanilla web tech site.\nClosing Thoughts\nI think it's lazy to default to JavaScript for the backend when simple, easy to get started with solutions like Rocket exist. Yes, you have to know Rust, and that can be a blocker, but you don't have to know that much Rust. You sure won't be forced into dealing with lifetimes and all the higher order concepts alone. Rocket takes care of many things for you and quite simply just gets out of your way.\nThink about it, for your next project.\nReferences\nThe Rocket Programming Guide\nTera Template Engine for Rust\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-15-serving-the-web-with-rocket/","title":"Serving the Web with Rocket"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-20-this-week-in-rust/":{"body":"I'm two days late with my link to This Week in Rust.\nIn my own week in Rust, I decided to stop the random drifting between useless personal projects that never go anywhere and instead focus on a work related project.

This week, finally, I'm proud to say that something very workable and useful has finally come together...in full stack Rust.\nI've more than likely crated a raft of future me problems that I'll have to deal with at some point, but in the moment, it works and I'm proud of myself.\nI'm going to push the search tool to the production site tomorrow, then finish fleshing out the backend admin panel of the API, which eases managing of new and existing information.\nOverall, this project has really put me over the top with development using the Yew framework. I'm going to begin writing up a series of things about it, mostly so I have a place to refer back to. If it helps someone else, that's icing on the cake.\nFun times.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-25-this-week-in-rust/","title":"This Week in Rust"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-10-04-this-week-in-rust/":{"body":"Falling back on old habits again, that being late with my link to This Week in Rust.\nI'm off for a couple of weeks, with an eye to re-inventing myself just a little bit. I'm constantly feeling annoyed/disappointed/frustrated with who I am as person. Must be my own version of a mid-life crisis. Anyhow, I will not bore you with anything about this right now.\nI started exploring Leptos a little this week, via a re-do of my NASA Imagery Viewer. Overall, Leptos is not that much different from Yew. Reactivity and the notion of signals are a lot to digest...and I'm still digesting. I can also see I'm going to have to seriously brush up on closures and how to use them. Much of what you need in Leptos around reactivity is done with closures.\nI will keep Yew in the toolbelt, but to be frank, I feel it's going to die. There seems to be zero activity around it and zero effort to move the framework forward, which I guess doesn't matter, as it works in it's current state. Leptos seems to have a lot of momentum behind it and the documentation is far better than that for Yew.\nThere's no harm in knowing both.\nAlso, this is sacrilege, but I may return to dabbling in JavaScript and continue learning React. I know, I know, utter heresy from a self-professed Rust shill. Here's the thing. I was admonished months ago by the internet to level up and be less language centric. After all, languages are secondary and the real superpower is problem solving and picking the right tool for the job. Also, in this modern age, knowing JavaScript is unfortunately a must. All this stuff I'm doing with WebAssembly on the front end is loaded into the browser by, you guessed it, JavaScript.\nI do want to level up and be less Rust centric.\nIt's going to take a long time though.\nThat's all for this week. Hope your own Rust adventures are going well.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-10-04-this-week-in-rust/","title":"This Week in Rust"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-10-05-getting-started-with-yew/":{"body":"Introduction\nWhat if I said there was a different way to build for the web?\nThere is, it's called WebAssembly. The Rust programming language, of which this author is so fond, can target WebAssembly. This means you can leverage Rust's type system and inherent memory safety to build for the web.\nWebAssembly is supported by all major browsers and is a completely viable way to build a web application. Two things are holding it back, a) the hegemony of the JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and b) the perceived difficulty of learning Rust. Frankly I'm not sure Rust front end web dev will truly ever be a thing, but for those of us that want to, it can be a happy and productive thing today. The main attraction, IMHO, is that you're not cobbling together 600 tools like you have to in the JavaScript world.\nAs soon as I found out Rust could be a viable choice for front end development, I said \"I'm in\".\nLet's take a closer look.\nEnter Yew\nThere are several up and coming front end frameworks that are worth looking at. The oldest, and probably most stable (don't let the 0.21 version number fool you) is Yew. This is the one I started on and the one I've been focusing on the most. I enjoy it a lot, it's very React like and retains the familiar notion of composing a web application out of re-usable components. It has state, hooks, a router, and is pretty much ready to go for whatever you want to do.\nSetup\nInstall Rust\nThere is some setup to get off the ground. First thing, if you haven't already, is install Rust. The official instructions are here. The minimum supported Rust version for Yew is 1.76.0. Older versions will not compile. If you have Rust installed already and just need to update your toolchain, do: rustup update\nInstall WebAssembly Target\nThe compilation target for browser-based WebAssembly is called wasm32-unknown-unknown. Yes, I know it sounds wierd. The unknown-unknown thing bugged me for a long while, but I'm over that now. Install it:\n\nInstall Trunk\nThe easiest build tool for managing and deploying your WebAssembly creations is called trunk. It's really nice, and very straightforward to use. Install it via cargo:\n\nAlright, setup is done. Let's get on with a proverbial \"Hello, World!\", but with a Yew flavour.\nCreate the Project\nFirst thing is to navigate to wherever you save your development projects. Once there, do:\n\nThis will start a new Rust project and change you into the freshly created directory that holds it. Replace the contents of the Cargo.toml file with this:\n\nThis adds the latest stable version of Yew, hosted on crates.io, as a dependency to your project. It adds the \"csr\" feature, which enables client side rendering, meaning the application you create is rendered in the target browser. Yew does have server side rendering capability, but it's on the experimental side at the moment. For now, the end result will be a single page application, exactly the same as you'd build with a JavaScript library or framework.\nNow, go into src/main.rs, delete the boilerplate that's there and swap out with this:\n\nThe very last piece we need is an html file to target. Create index.html at the root of your project and add:\n\nTrunk will use this index.html to build out the assets for deployment. That's pretty much all that's need to get started.\nMoment of Truth\nTo see all the fine fruits of your labours, back at your command prompt, type:\n\nThis will start up trunk's hot reloading development server. Now, open your default browser to display your handiwork. You should be greeted with a very boring \"Hello, World\" message in the main window of your browser. On the one hand yes, it's boring. On the other, take a step back and think about what you just did.\nYou built a web site...with Rust. Yes, there's HTML there, because you have to have that, but otherwise, it's all done in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly and run by your browser. There is just the tinest bit of JavaScript in there because it's needed to load the WebAssembly file that Rust built.\nConclusion\nThis is a quick taste, to get you off the ground. There are a lot of details here that I've glossed over, in an effort to introduce the notion of web dev with Rust. In the future, I'll circle back on some of the inner workings. Also in a future article, I'll dive more into how to flesh out this simple site with assets and styles to begin to make it more interesting.\nThanks for reading!\nReferences\n\nYew Tutorial\n\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-10-05-getting-started-with-yew/","title":"Yew: First Steps"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/projects/":{"body":"Here are some projects I'm working on or have worked on.\nFrontend Web Dev in WebAssembly\nNASA Imagery Viewer\nI just don't want to be the billionth person focusing on the traditional web stack of HTML/CSS/Javascript. As a hobbyist, I have the ability to explore different things. Thii project is a simple web page, compiled to WebAssembly using Yew for Rust, served up with a minimal Rocket web server, hosted on Shuttle.\nBackend Development - APIs\nCrusty Rustacean Newsletter API\nThis project is my completed take on Zero to Production in Rust by Luca Palmieri. I did it using the Axum web framework, instead of Actix Web. I deployed this project, for a time, on Railway, but took it down as I became increasingly nervous about having something less than amateurish exposed to the internet. I'm thinking about getting it going again...on Shuttle.\nShuttle Template - Hyper\nI mess about with stuff so that you don't have to. Anyone in their right mind would build their API with Axum (or the other framework of your choice) and call it a day, but not me! I'm going nap-of-earth with Hyper and Tokio, just in case you want to see for yourself what not to do. I've managed to create a skeleton API and have turned it into a template of sorts. It's a mainly a learning ground for me, as I can't stand just reading theory without getting my hands dirty.\nFrontend Development\nShuttle Template - Yew\nI don't want to be the billionth person learning React. I enjoy front end development with Rust and have been steadily picking up how to do things with Yew.\nDoing Things with Community Crates\nFun with Nom\nEarly in 2024, I developed a wierd obsession with the Nom crate. I tried to using late in 2023 while working through Shuttle's Christas Code Hunt. In typical fashion for me, I was way over my head, running before even crawling. I figured I'd start building out an API that returned the word count of a sentence handed to it. The project is not deployed, but I may yet return to it. There are precious few resources out there for mere mortals on how to use this crate.\n","id":"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/projects/","title":"projects"},"https://jeff-mitchell.dev/resources/":{"body":"This is my sort of clearing house of resources, both Rust related and Rust
