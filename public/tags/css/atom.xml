        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-01-utter-frustration-that-is-css-morning-after/">&lt;p&gt;It is the day after yesterday&#x27;s mini CSS induced meltdown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is brighter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Metallica page is started and available here: &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metallica-seattle-2024-eqpf.shuttle.app&quot;&gt;Metallica Weekend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you finding and reading my content, yesterday is a bit of a warning. I will, on occasion, freak out and be public in my freaking out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least you know this writing is mine, from a real person, and not AI generated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;m still no closer to a solid, viable method for learning CSS. I read a bit of the MDN documentation on it this morning, which I&#x27;ve read before but always found borderline helpful. I think the core of my issue is I want one resource to tell me how to lay out a page, in a clear and unambiguous way. Not sure that makes any sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want the answer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add extra flavour, in my mind people are judging me as weak for not immediately having the answer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I&#x27;ve struggled with my whole life...I just...want..the answer. Oftentimes, my brain is unable to figure out what it needs to do to get to the answer, it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s missing bits or something. How can I train my brain to enjoy the journey and not just the end result?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, onwards and upwards. This writing is my way of therapy. Apologies for the rant yesterday and I thank you for reading my trials and tribulations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-31-the-utter-frustration-that-is-css/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m currently in Seattle, saturating myself with two nights of all things Metallica. I started making a simple little site, with Rocket and hosted on Shuttle, as a way of immortalizing the weekend. I wanted to put up the set lists (I write them down as the songs are played) and display a few photos...maybe a video clip  or two.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve got the site organized with Rocket server, assets, templates...all the bones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go to style it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I bash my head against CSS. I hate this fuckin&#x27; shit...I&#x27;m serious, I really, really loathe it. Every time...every single time, I sling code for hours against &lt;code&gt;screen.css&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, like the Peter Griffin in that gif with the blinds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know my loathing is rooted in ignorance. Trust me, I get it. I just don&#x27;t know what to do or what resource to use to learn it in a way that&#x27;s effective for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many things, but typically the learning resources approach the topic from a direction that my mind rejects. Yes, properties, selectors, etc. are important to know, but I can&#x27;t connect in my mind how those building blocks translate to the actual result I want to see on the site.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos are useless to me, I have to be in there typing and getting my hands dirty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The written content approaches the topic from the wrong direction, as I said a moment ago.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My typical fallback has been to grudgingly grab Tailwind and use ChatGPT to give me roughly what I want. I don&#x27;t really want to be using tools like this, I&#x27;d rather have some basic level of compentance with CSS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I just don&#x27;t know what to do to get anywhere near productive. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my Metallica site will never see the light of day, which makes me sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Back to Basics: How the Web Works</title>

        <id>https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-25-back-to-basics-how-the-web-works/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-25-back-to-basics-how-the-web-works/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-basics&quot;&gt;Back to Basics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeff-mitchell.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;2024-08-24-slow-down-to-speed-up&#x2F;&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I&#x27;m going to write a few pieces about the basics of how the web works. Much of my motivation for getting into Rust was WebAssembly, and wanting to take a different path to become a productive web developer. I haven&#x27;t spent near enough time just understanding how exactly the web functions. I&#x27;ve had a stubborn refusal to really dig into the basic building blocks. I&#x27;ll never be independent if I don&#x27;t understand these foundations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#x27;m going to rectify that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-wide-web&quot;&gt;The World Wide Web&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&#x27;ve learned Earth&#x27;s languages through the World Wide Web&amp;quot; - Optimus Prime&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the world web web anyway? Does anyone even call it that anymore?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a city in which there are buildings that offer services. Every building has an address and when you visit there as a client, there are helpful staff who give back information which you can then take and assemble into something meaningful. The buildings are servers and they offer web sites. You, as client act as the web browser. When you visit an internet location, a server answers and gives you back a series of files which your browser takes and renders into something meaningful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is overly simplistic, but there&#x27;s a lot to unpack at each step and having a high level view of what&#x27;s going on can help.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every web site, every last one, is built on this foundation of technologies:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods and techniques may vary, but at the end of the day that&#x27;s what the browser needs to render information to you as the viewer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web server gives back an HTML file (usually called index.html) which has links to styles (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript). When a browser makes requests for these resources, it does that via links available in the HTML file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;structure-hyper-text-markup-language-html&quot;&gt;Structure (Hyper-Text Markup Language, HTML)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every web site needs bones and a skeleton. It&#x27;s HTML&#x27;s job to express how a web site, including its content and structure, is to be represented. This is the first thing the browser loads. The browser constructs a model in memory, called the Document Object Model (DOM). I always feel slightly dirty when I say DOM...I digress...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;styles-cascading-style-sheets-css&quot;&gt;Styles (Cascading Style Sheets, CSS)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s the job of CSS to express what a web site looks like. CSS rules allow you to selectively target HTML elements and apply a style to them. This is the second thing loaded by the browser. The browser also constructs a CSS Object Model (CSSOM) which can be targeted and manipulated dynamically with JavaScript. The style and structure are ultimately combined into a &amp;quot;render tree&amp;quot; which the browser uses to &amp;quot;paint&amp;quot; the final web site into view.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;functionality-javascript&quot;&gt;Functionality (JavaScript)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web site can exist with only HTML and CSS, technically you don&#x27;t need anything else. However, it&#x27;s static and relatively boring. You can do a lot with these technologies now, more than 10 years ago, and depending on what you&#x27;re doing minimal interactivity might be fine. Generally speaking though, you&#x27;re going to need some JavaScript. It enables interactivity, the ability to manipulate state, and the ability to change the page content, structure, and style dynamically. JavaScript is the very last thing the browser loads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing&quot;&gt;Closing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very basic overview of the fundamental web technologies and how individual web sites work. I&#x27;ll explore each one further and write about them over the next while. You can also read the resources I&#x27;ve linked below for more background!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
