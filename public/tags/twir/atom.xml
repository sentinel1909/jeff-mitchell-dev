        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-10-04-this-week-in-rust/">&lt;p&gt;Falling back on old habits again, that being late with my link to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;this-week-in-rust.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;02&#x2F;this-week-in-rust-567&#x2F;&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m off for a couple of weeks, with an eye to re-inventing myself just a little bit. I&#x27;m constantly feeling annoyed&#x2F;disappointed&#x2F;frustrated with who I am as person. Must be my own version of a mid-life crisis. Anyhow, I will not bore you with anything about this right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started exploring &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leptos.dev&quot;&gt;Leptos&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a little this week, via a re-do of my &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nasa-imagery-viewer-v2-xggw.shuttle.app&quot;&gt;NASA Imagery Viewer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Overall, Leptos is not that much different from Yew. Reactivity and the notion of signals are a lot to digest...and I&#x27;m still digesting. I can also see I&#x27;m going to have to seriously brush up on closures and how to use them. Much of what you need in Leptos around reactivity is done with closures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep Yew in the toolbelt, but to be frank, I feel it&#x27;s going to die. There seems to be zero activity around it and zero effort to move the framework forward, which I guess doesn&#x27;t matter, as it works in it&#x27;s current state. Leptos seems to have a lot of momentum behind it and the documentation is far better than that for Yew.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no harm in knowing both.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this is sacrilege, but I &lt;em&gt;may&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; return to dabbling in JavaScript and continue learning React. I know, I know, utter heresy from a self-professed Rust shill. Here&#x27;s the thing. I was admonished months ago by the internet to level up and be less language centric. After all, languages are secondary and the real superpower is problem solving and picking the right tool for the job. Also, in this modern age, knowing JavaScript is unfortunately a must. All this stuff I&#x27;m doing with WebAssembly on the front end is loaded into the browser by, you guessed it, JavaScript.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to level up and be less Rust centric.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s going to take a long time though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all for this week. Hope your own Rust adventures are going well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-25-this-week-in-rust/">&lt;p&gt;What do you know? I&#x27;m on time with &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;this-week-in-rust.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;this-week-in-rust-566&#x2F;&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For some reason I waited to see it appear in my daily.dev feed, but today I thought, don&#x27;t need to do that!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rusty-v8-stabilized&quot;&gt;Announcing Stable V8 Bindings for Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was the story that caught my eye this week. Gonna explore this some more. I dislike JavaScript, but somehow using it from within the context of Rust intrigues me. JavaScript is unfortunately a necessary evil in today&#x27;s world. I&#x27;ve always had difficulty learning it because it lacks the structure I&#x27;m used to from programming languages I learned in the past.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own Rust adventure this week saw me complete the back end and front end for a Code Knowledge Base search tool for my office. Last night, with a bit of debugging help from ChatGPT, I implemented keyword search. This morning I took that code and filled in the tests and API endpoint for the companion code reference search. I made the tool live on the staging version of my office intranet site project, which is written in WebAsssembly via Yew. The build assets are deployed onto IIS where staff access the page via their browser of choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of background about this project...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have weekly stand up meetings on Tuesdays, and frequently staff will ask questions Building Code related questions which we as a group attempt help answer. As you can imagine, this can be come somewhat of a rabbit hole a lot of times, but it&#x27;s a good way to hear opinions and perspectives on whatever the question is. I&#x27;ve been wanting for months (years) to develop a knowledge base of this material, which could be supplemented with external information and opinions. This week, finally, I&#x27;m proud to say that something very workable and useful has finally come together...in full stack Rust.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve more than likely crated a raft of future me problems that I&#x27;ll have to deal with at some point, but in the moment, it works and I&#x27;m proud of myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m going to push the search tool to the production site tomorrow, then finish fleshing out the backend admin panel of the API, which eases managing of new and existing information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this project has really put me over the top with development using the Yew framework. I&#x27;m going to begin writing up a series of things about it, mostly so I have a place to refer back to. If it helps someone else, that&#x27;s icing on the cake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-20-this-week-in-rust/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m two days late with my link to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;this-week-in-rust.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;this-week-in-rust-565&#x2F;&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own week in Rust, I decided to stop the random drifting between useless personal projects that never go anywhere and instead focus on a work related project. I&#x27;ve built out an office intranet site with Yew. I had a knowledge breakthrough with form handling and events, which allowed me to bring the Yew site up to par functionally with the React version I&#x27;d previously built.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also resumed work on the Actix Web backend for a Code interpretations knowledge base for my staff to use. I&#x27;m creating a searchable knowledge base of our internal building code related decisions and discussions. This week I managed to get it live to the point of being usable. Progress! Tasks for next week are to add update and delete functionality to the web form template I started for creating new entries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I want to write something on generics and &lt;em&gt;may&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; start to look at Diesel. Thus far in my Rust journey I&#x27;ve focused on using raw SQLx, but in discussing with others I can see maybe there&#x27;s benefit in knowing one ORM.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m also going to start a series of pieces on Yew. I want to create a resource mostly for myself that I can look at to refresh on how to do things. The Yew docs are a hair weak in that regard. They assume you know what you&#x27;re doing and have web dev experience, which I didn&#x27;t have nearly as much as I should.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it! Hope you are all making progress in your own Rust journey...or whatever language you&#x27;ve chosen to focus on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-09-12-this-week-in-rust/">&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, it&#x27;s Thursday, which means it&#x27;s time for &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;this-week-in-rust.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;this-week-in-rust-564&#x2F;&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which went live yesterday.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve only skimmed this weeks issue. One thing that stood out to me was &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientificcomputing.rs&#x2F;monthly&#x2F;2024-09&quot;&gt;Scientific Computing in Rust #2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I always nurse the desire to write some piece of computational fluid dynamics software using Rust, but for the moment that goal is out of reach...because skill issues. :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-week-in-rust&quot;&gt;My Week in Rust&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have I been working on this week?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per usual, I drift. I started out the week all fired up about my own static site generator in Rust. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t get far. I have some frustrations with Zola (this platform), and to work through those am working on another version of this blog that will not involve a pre-made theme, but the going is slow there. I&#x27;m unfortunately impatient , which often impacts my ability to truly learn. Always on my mind is building something I understand and document from the ground up, because frequently I just can&#x27;t get into the minds and documentation of others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I embarked on a redo of my office intranet site using the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yew.rs&quot;&gt;Yew&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; web framework for Rust. I discovered Yew back in 2022 and have always found it approachable and &amp;quot;React&amp;quot; like, in terms of how to structure a web site with routes, views and components. Some aspects of Yew, such as handling form input, and enabling interactivity, have troubled me and I was unable to make progress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last week...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, when Google searching about Yew and how to do things, I discovered &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workfall.com&#x2F;learning&#x2F;blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Workfall Blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. In particular, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workfall.com&#x2F;learning&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-handle-forms-efficiently-in-yew-web-development&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about form handling kind of filled in some missing pieces I couldn&#x27;t glean from the Yew documentation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, I practiced in my own intranet site project and am pleased to say that I finally understand how to handle form input. I intend on writing up my own version of that Workfall blog article, to demonstrate my understanding and maybe help out others by creating something more up to date.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;upcoming-articles&quot;&gt;Upcoming Articles&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered I started a piece about serving the web with Rocket. I&#x27;ll finish that this coming weekend and get it posted. I also have a piece in the oven about error handling. I want to work a small example and give you my thoughts on Rust error handling. Aiming for early next week on both of those.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it for this week everyone, thanks for reading!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, loads of great content to digest this week. The article I highlighted yesterday, about the option of alternate executors, is in the mix.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other Rust news, Rust 1.81 is live today. Read all the details on the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rust-lang.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;09&#x2F;05&#x2F;Rust-1.81.0.html&quot;&gt;Rust Blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m down in Seattle for the two Metallica shows that are happening tomorrow and Sunday, yesterday was a travel day down from Vancouver AND I brought my work laptop which was not as fully configured for personal development stuff as my normal computers. Up to speed now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticed that the article I wrote for Shuttle, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shuttle.rs&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;23&#x2F;rust-as-my-first-language&quot;&gt;Rust as my First Language&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; made it into this week&#x27;s edition, neat!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, enjoy your TWIR fix for this week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a piece about HashMaps in the works, but am currently attempting to unravel the &lt;code&gt;entry&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; API, so it might be awhile yet before that piece gets published.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I read this &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corrode.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dont-use-preludes-and-globs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;great piece&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, currated by the &amp;quot;This Week in Rust&amp;quot; folks, regarding the use of preludes and globs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Don&#x27;t. The author considers them an anti-pattern.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to not use preludes myself. I like to pull in only what I need AND it helps me to understand specifically what I&#x27;m using from the library.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
