For some reason, if you don&#x27;t append &amp;quot;index.html&amp;quot; to the end of all routes, your browser will display an error page with &amp;quot;too many redirects&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll be exploring this further in the coming days, mostly to learn, but am also working behind the scenes on an alternate blog which will be hosted on Netlify. That is a few weeks...no wait, let&#x27;s not be overly optimistic...months away though and am targeting the beginning of next year to make it go live.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Slow Down...to Speed Up...Reflections on the Coding Journey</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-24-slow-down-to-speed-up/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m in a reflective mood this evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel a bit triggered by my inabilty to build my own Redis on &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecrafters.io&quot;&gt;codecraters.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I figured out the first 4 stages of the &amp;quot;Build Your Own Redis&amp;quot; challenge, pretty much on my own. I hit Stage 5 though, with the need to build a Redis Protocol Parser, and pretty much found myself unable to reason through the steps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started watching one of the walkthnroughs and immediately started to hate myself for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&#x27;ve got to slow down to speed up&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Slow is smooth smooth is fast&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Try to focus on the process, rather than the result. As soon as you start enjoying the beauty of the process, results&#x2F;value will come naturally&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are messages I&#x27;ve read, or have been told, by the internet the past few days. This weekend, they are really ringing true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been at this coding thing, basically every day, since late December 2020. I&#x27;ve developed a lot of muscle memory, and overall my understanding has grown by leaps and bounds. Even with that, I&#x27;m not improving as much as I want in terms of my problem solving ability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not going to quit, far from it, but I&#x27;m definitely going to take a step back and figure out another path. It&#x27;s not Rust per se, it&#x27;s not the language syntax, it&#x27;s a fundamental inability to break things down into small tasks...smaller problems. I&#x27;m unable to ask questions about the task and in doing that form smaller problems to solve. All I can seem to focus on is the final result.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to find a way to address this fundamental flaw in my abilities...this obsession with pushing the final result out of my forehead, like Athena sprining from Zeus, without actually doing the work to get there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rush stops here and now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to slow down to speed up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-12-update-to-projects/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-08-12-update-to-projects/">&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, I should be finishing the long-promised Hash Map article. It&#x27;s coming, it&#x27;s coming...I just had to get something off my chest first. I go off on random quests on things that no sane person would do, like using nothing by Hyper and Tokio to build a server. I&#x27;ve done that, created a skeleton, and added a link to the repo on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeff-mitchell.dev&#x2F;projects&#x2F;&quot;&gt;projects&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of use, I&#x27;m not sure this Hyper adventure will ever turn into anything particularly useful. I&#x27;m interested in creating a bullet journaling system for myself, but it&#x27;s not likely that vague notion will ever become reality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, give your head a shake and don&#x27;t follow in my footsteps by raw-dogging the Hyper crate...remember, you&#x27;ve been warned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-07-14-jeff-mitchell-dev-re-reloaded/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://jeff-mitchell.dev/blog/2024/2024-07-14-jeff-mitchell-dev-re-reloaded/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-road-so-far&quot;&gt;The Road So Far...&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It embarrasses me to think on how many times I&#x27;ve tried to start a blog.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress, Zola, Medium, roll-your-own, micro-blogging with Twitter (now X), probably some tools I&#x27;ve forgotten...I&#x27;ve tried and failed so many times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s really shameful, the amount of time spent...wasted really.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core problem, in all the efforts so far, is a focus on the &amp;quot;platform&amp;quot;, rather than the &amp;quot;writing&amp;quot;. I say I want to write, yet if I&#x27;m honest with myself I avoid it by all these platform iterations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more...really this time, no more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead...&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the latest, and hopefully last, iteration of my developer oriented blog, built on &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getzola.org&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a static site generator built in Rust. I hope to learn and write about Zola in the time ahead, as there is very little content out there about it. I did write quite a lot of content through mid-2022 to the end of 2023, so I&#x27;ll be tidying that up and getting it up here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &amp;quot;developer&amp;quot;, yet I should be careful. I&#x27;m a hobbyist who thinks he can be a software developer. I run before I walk most of the time and spend far too many hours just slinging code at the Rust compiler hoping something sticks. I can get away with that because it&#x27;s all just a hobby and my day job doesn&#x27;t depend on it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I hope you&#x27;ll derive some benefit from reading. Rust is less than 10 years old and all things considered is still just starting out. Here, in my writing, I&#x27;ll provide my own perspective in learning Rust, which hopefully, you&#x27;ll find somethign that benefits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now there is no comments section, nor am I planning one anytime soon. The internet is horrible, no, people on the internet are horrible, and I&#x27;d rather not hear from them. If what you read here leaves you the feeling I&#x27;m an idiot who&#x27;s full of shit, stop reading and move on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for spending time here and I do hope you derive some benefit, however small, to enable your own Rust questing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
